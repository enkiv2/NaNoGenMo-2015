 Theme, Topic, Point, Thesis. The first three of these words are often
 popularly used as exactly synonymous. Daniel Webster puts within a
 few lines of each other the two following sentences: [If an American
 Thucydides should arise,] “may his theme not be a Peloponnesian war,”
 and [American history] “will furnish no topic for a Gibbon.” Yet,
 strictly in rhetoric, and more often in general use, subject is the
 broad word for anything written or spoken about, while theme is the
 word for the exact and generally narrower statement of the subject. A
 topic is a still narrower subject; there may be several interesting
 topics suggested under a single subject. A point is by its primary
 meaning the smallest possible subdivision under a subject. Thesis
 is a technical word for a subject which takes the form of an exact
 proposition or assertion which is to be proved: as, Luther fastened his
 ninety-five theses to the church-door. The paper in which the proof of a
 thesis is attempted is also called a thesis. A student's composition is
 often called a theme. The meaning of the other words is not extended
 to the written or spoken discourse. See proposition. In this use,
 especially in continuation of the statement implied by assent to a
 previous question. The continuation may mark surprise, incredulity,
 indignation, etc.: as, And shall I see him again? And you dare thus
 address me? predicate. To make known; make an announcement See thee.

 Less, Fewer. Smaller is rather more exact than less, but is used freely
 of persons and of things both concrete and abstract: as, a smaller man,
 soul, size. Less is not used of persons: as, less trouble, happiness,
 size, degree; less of an evil. With reference to size and number, the
 proper words are smaller and fewer. “This apple is less than that,”
 “There were less people there than I expected,” are inelegant
 and erroneous, although similar expressions are often used both in
 speech and in writing. While the latter, however, is in excusable, the
 former may be used sparingly without offense in certain collocations,
 especially in poetry. The allusion to the mustard-seed in Mark iv. 31
 appears to be the only example in the Bible of the use of less in the
 sense of ‘smaller in size.’ In Shakspere's plays the word occurs
 more than two hundred times, and in Milton's poems more than a hundred;
 in the former it is used only four or five times and in the latter
 three times in the sense of ‘smaller in size,’ and never in that of
 ‘fewer.’ Expressing a point in time. like a sponge in being able to

 Discuss, plead, expostulate, remonstrate. To argue is to defend one's
 opinion, or to exhibit reasons or proofs in favor of some assertion
 or principle; it implies a process of detailed proof by one or more
 persons. To dispute may be to call in question the statements or
 arguments of an opposing party: as, to dispute about an award. It often
 means the alternate giving of reasons, especially by two persons. It is
 often applied to mere bickering, and is in general less dignified than
 the other words. To debate is to interchange arguments in a somewhat
 formal manner, as in debating societies and legislative bodies. To
 discuss is, by derivation, to shake or knock a subject to pieces in order
 to find the truth, or the best thing to be done. A debate, therefore,
 may be viewed as a discussion, or a discussion as a debate. Strictly,
 a discussion is an amicable presentation of opinions, not limited,
 like the others, to affirmative and negative sides of a proposition,
 and with the expectation on the part of all that the conclusion will
 be the adoption of no one person's opinion or plan unmodified. To
 argue a point, to dispute a position, to dispute with a neighbor, to
 debate a motion, to discuss a subject or a plan. Used to indicate a
