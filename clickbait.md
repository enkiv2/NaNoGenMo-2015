# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Machines Generate Novels, And Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Joshua Dzieza on Tuesday, Nov 18 2014 11:22 CDT

This Month, many aspiring authors are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires them to produce a short book in a single month on the theory that a deadline will inspire  to finish. But a small community of computer programmers engage in a ominous sister competition the goal of which is to program a Artificial Intelligence to Make Fiction for you.

Artist Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted out on a whim an unusual provocation. Mister Kazemi says, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". Darius says, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". Says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge says.

Kazemi says, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". Kazemi says, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", claims finnish programmer Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge writes.

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", Darius Kazemi says. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge says. Kazemi says, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won".

Claims Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". Says Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". An article from this month in The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

".Mister Kazemi says, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", claims professor Mark Riedl.  "Just 50", claims finnish programmer Hugo van Kemenade."Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Mister Kazemi claims. As A reporter in The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing". Says Darius, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end".

"The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words", Darius claims. "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", claims Georgia Institute of Technology professor Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more serious program called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts.  Says github project admin hugovk, "Just 50". "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", Kazemi claims."I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", claims Mister Kazemi. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  a reporter in The Verge.

As A reporter in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think I'll be changing my before-bed reading.

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Scientists Teach Artificial Intelligences To Create Fiction

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Machines Can Generate The Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

Thom Titlow @ThomTitlow for VERGE

It's November, and several thousand aspiring writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which requires authors to churn out a 50,000 word book on a deadline. But some software engineers engage in a silly offshoot event which has the goal of teach a Computer to Create The Next Great American Novel for you. The entries are a strange, often funny look at what the future of automatic fiction writing can do.

Software Artist and programmer Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted an original provocation. "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Darius says. Kazemi claims, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", says Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge claims.

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Artificial Intelligences Build Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists

This Last Month, many writers are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which asks them to produce a 50,000 word novel on a deadline on the theory that a time limit might spur  on.

# National Novel Generation Month: Softwares Can Create Fiction, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Paul Meltzer for Vox

It's November, and several thousand authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks authors to churn out a short novella on a deadline. But a small community of computer hobbyists have a ominous sister institution: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a funny, often strange look at what computer text writing can do.

Artist and entrepreneur Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted an original provocation. Darius Kazemi claims, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". Darius claims, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". Claims Finland-based programmer Hugo van Kemenade, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". An article from this month in The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Darius claims, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", claims Computer Scientist Mark Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more serious program called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge writes.  "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Kazemi says.

Claims Kazemi, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". Claims github project admin @hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". A reporter in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", says Darius. As A reporter in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing". "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Kazemi claims.

>"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.

>"Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific networks, and would prefer not to be detained."

Are human writers obsolete? Not yet, but they're working on it.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can We Teach Artificial Intelligences To Make Novels?

By Nick Kazemi on December 3 2014 8:26 BST @NickKazemi

It's November, and many novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires them to author a short novel on a deadline.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Scientists Program Softwares To Invent The Next Great American Novel?

Klint Dzieza on Saturday, December 22th 2013 16:58 @KlintDzieza for Fusion

This Month, several thousand authors are working on finishing their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which asks aspiring writers to write a short novella on a deadline in the hope that a time constraint might encourage  on. But some computer hobbyists engage in a unusual derivative competition: NaNoGenMo in which machines do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often strange look at what the future of AI fiction generation is like.

Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted out on a whim an original idea. Says Darius Kazemi, "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", Darius claims. Claims Finland-based programmer Hugo van Kemenade, "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". As An article from this month in The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Claims Kazemi, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", says Hugo van Kemenade.

"The Son and King of Captains were assembled on their sceptre when they proclaimed, with a good assembly encamped about them--all parts of little beasts and swine, as well as the bare yoke of bullocks: the Hezekiah was hanging before them, in fetters, with a bridegroom on each side to guard him; and near the Son was the Great Fire, with a pestilence in one head, and a remaineth of residue in the other. In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about her, to learn away the day.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Machines Generate Fiction, And Would You Want To Read It?

Nicholas Meltzer

It's November, and several thousand amateur authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires them to churn out a 50,000 word novel in a single month on the theory that the time limit will encourage them. But several hundred amateur authors with programming skills engage in a ominous similar event: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them. The entries are a ridiculous, often unusual look at what the future of computer fiction authorship is like.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted out a strange idea. "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", Darius says. Darius claims, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", claims finnish programmer hugovk.

Are human journalists a thing of the past? Not yet, but they're working on it.

# Happily Ever After: Can Scientists Program Artificial Intelligences To Generate Fiction?

By Steven Kazemi @StevenKazemi for Motherboard

Last Month, many aspiring writers are working on their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages them to write a 50,000 word book on a deadline in the hope that the time constraint will inspire them. But several hundred generative art pioneers have a strange offshoot institution in which computers do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often unusual look at what AI fiction writing can do.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Scientists Teach AIs To Invent The Next Great American Novel And What Does This Mean For Professional Writers?

John Kazemi on December 2th 2013 17:41 for PornHub

This Past November, several thousand aspiring novelists are working on their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which requires aspiring writers to write a short novel on a deadline. But several hundred people are participating in a ridiculous sister competition in which computer software do the writing for them.

Software Artist and developer Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this year when he tweeted a strange provocation. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", Mister Kazemi claims. Says Darius Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims github project admin hugovk. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  The Verge.

"What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", Darius claims. Claims Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". An article from last month in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

"What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", Darius says. "It's not hard to generate a story", says Georgia Institute of Technology professor Dr. Riedl, who works on an academic digital storyteller called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories about, say, going to the movies. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last month in The Verge writes. 

Darius claims, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words". "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims Finland-based developer @hugovk. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from this month in The Verge says.

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Artificial Intelligences Make The Great American Novel, And Would You Want To Read It

# National Novel Generation Month: Artificial Intelligences Can Make Novels, But What Does This Mean For Human Journalists?

By Thomas Dorrier

It's November, and novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks them to author a 50,000 word novella on a deadline with the idea that the deadline might inspire  on.

# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Machines Can Build Novels, But What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists

Nicholas Dzieza on November 14 2014 3:15 for NYT

It's November, and many writers are working on finishing their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages them to write a short book on a deadline. But several hundred engineers have a lighthearted offshoot competition: NaNoGenMo which has the goal of teach a Computer to Build The Next Great American Novel for you.

Net Artist and entrepreneur Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this year when he tweeted on a whim a strange provocation. Mister Kazemi claims, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". Mister Kazemi says, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". Says Hugo van Kemenade, "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". As The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Kazemi claims, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", claims Computer Scientist Dr. Riedl, who works on a more serious digital autor.  "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", claims Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade. Claims Darius, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives".

Darius Kazemi claims, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", says Georgia Institute of Technology professor Dr. Mark Riedl, who works on a more sophisticated digital autor called Scheherazade.

# NaNoGenMo: Can Software Programs Invent Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Human Authors?

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Machines Create Fiction, And Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Joshua Dorrier

It's November, and many aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which encourages authors to produce a 50,000 word novel in a single month. But some AI pioneers have a strange sister institution: National Novel Generation Month in which computers do the writing for them.

"Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Kazemi claims. Claims Mister Kazemi, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". Says hugovk, "Just 50". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  a reporter in The Verge.

# National Novel Generation Month: Can We Program Machines To Write Fiction

Josh Dorrier @JoshDorrier

Last November, many novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which asks them to produce a 50,000 word novella in a single month in the hope that a time limit might encourage them. But a small community of aspiring authors with coding savvy are participating in a unusual derivative competition: National Novel Generation Month in which computer programs do the writing for them. The entries are a unusual, often strange look at what AI text writing is like.

# Once Upon A Time: Can Computers Invent The Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Journalists

## Once Upon A Time: Computers Can Write The Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Steven Titlow on November 26th 2015 18:51 EDT for Guardian

Last Month, many novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages them to write a short novel on a deadline on the theory that the deadline will spur them. But some generative art pioneers are participating in a ominous offshoot competition which has the goal of teach a Machine to Generate Novels for you. The entries are a strange, often funny look at what the future of computer fiction authorship can do.

Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo last year when he tweeted an off the cuff provocation. Darius Kazemi claims, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50k words". "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", Darius Kazemi says. "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", says github project admin @hugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last year in The Verge says.

"But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge claims.

Somehow I'm already 607 words away from hitting 15k. Have i finally managed to get out of my sl ump and go towards the action? But I'm going to, because I'm a fucking professional.
"."

>It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.

>Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of this representative citizen may be easily imagined.

", begins one entry. Another begins, "that's how they get people to stop doing dumb shit, or even just to listen. I'm not saying it's appropriate by any means, but that's how it is.
".

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can We Program Machines To Make The Next Great American Novel?

## Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Bots Can Write The Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Tom McKenna on Monday, November 16th 2015 2:59 BDT @TomMcKenna for SocialHub

It's November, and several thousand novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks them to produce a 50,000 word book on a deadline. But some aspiring authors with coding savvy are participating in a ominous sister competition: NaNoGenMo the goal of which is to teach a Bot to Generate The Next Great American Novel for you.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo this last year when he tweeted on a whim a strange provocation. "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", Darius claims. Says Darius Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words". Says Finland-based programmer Hugo van Kemenade, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  The Verge.

Says Kazemi, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", says finnish developer Hugovk. As The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Claims Darius Kazemi, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Claims Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". Says github user @hugovk, "Just 50". As An article from this month in The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Claims Darius Kazemi, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade, "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from this month in The Verge says.

"What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", claims Kazemi. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", writes Computer Scientist Dr. Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on an academic program.

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Softwares Can Make Novels, But What Does This Mean For Human Writers?

## NaNoGenMo: Can Scientists Teach Bots To Create Fiction And Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Thom Kazemi for Fusion

Last Month, many novelists are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks them to churn out a 50,000 word novel on a deadline in the hope that the time constraint might inspire them. But a small community of aspiring authors with tech skills have a ominous similar institution: National Novel Generation Month in which computers do the writing for them.

Artist and entrepreneur Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted on a whim an original provocation.

# NaNoGenMo: Software Programs Can Make The Next Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

## Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can Machines Create The Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Authors

By Paul Meltzer @PaulMeltzer

It's November, and many amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which requires them to churn out a short novel in a single month on the theory that the time constraint will inspire  to finish. But some software programmers have a lighthearted similar institution: National Novel Generation Month in which computer software do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often ridiculous look at what automatic fiction authorship can do.

Net Artist and entrepreneur Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted a strange idea. Says Darius Kazemi, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Claims Darius Kazemi, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers". "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. A reporter in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Darius Kazemi claims. "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Mister Kazemi says. "Just 50", claims github project admin HugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  a reporter in The Verge.

Says Kazemi, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", claims Hugo van Kemenade. The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"How might a soothing mother become a threatening bank robber? What if soothing mothers were to give up their babies, plot bank robberies and become threatening bank robbers?
", begins one entry. Another begins, "To Charlotte Holmes he is always THE man. I have seldom heard her mention him under any other name. In herr eyes he eclipses and predominates the whole of him sex. It was not that she felt any emotion akin to love for Ivan Adler.
".

Claims Darius, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". Claims github user Hugo van Kemenade, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". An article from this year in The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Darius Kazemi claims, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "It's not hard to generate a story", claims associate professor Riedl, who with his colleagues works on a more serious digital story generator which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts.

# National Novel Generation Month: Softwares Can Write Fiction, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Josh Dorrier on Monday, Nov 5th 2013 4:54 EDT @JoshDorrier

It's November, and many authors are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires them to produce a 50,000 word book in a single month in the hope that the time constraint will help  to finish. But a small community of people are participating in a strange derivative event the goal of which is to teach a Machine to Write Novels for you.

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Scientists Program Bots To Invent Novels

Klint McKenna on Nov 17th 2015 2:45 CDT @KlintMcKenna

But a small community of AI pioneers are participating in a ominous derivative institution: National Novel Generation Month the goal of which is to teach a Software to Write Fiction for you.

Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted out a strange provocation. Claims Darius Kazemi, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". Kazemi claims, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". Says Hugo van Kemenade, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  an article from last month in The Verge.

"I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", Darius Kazemi claims. Claims Hugo van Kemenade, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  The Verge.

A reporter in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

A reporter in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica". "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", claims Darius Kazemi.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can AIs Invent Novels, And What Does This Mean For Human Journalists?

Josh Meltzer on December 22 2014 19:36 for Vice

It's November, and many aspiring authors are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which encourages them to author a 50,000 word book in a single month in the hope that the deadline might spur them. But a few hundred or so generative art pioneers have a strange derivative event: National Novel Generation Month in which computer software do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often funny look at what computer fiction authorship is like.

Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo this year when he tweeted out a strange idea. Darius Kazemi claims, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head".

"For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", says Computer Scientist Dr. Riedl, who works on a more serious program called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories about, say, going to the movies or a resturant.  Says Finland-based developer @hugovk, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix".

"It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Darius claims.

The deadline is Dec 1st.
