# Once Upon A Time: Can Machines Make Novels, And What Does This Mean For Professional Writers

## Happily Ever After: Artificial Intelligences Can Write Novels, But What Does This Mean For Human Authors

By Josh Kazemi on Dec 5 2014 18:56 for KurzweilAI

This Last Month, many aspiring authors are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires authors to write a short novel in a single month. But some aspiring authors with programming savvy have a unusual derivative competition in which one must teach a Machine to Make Novels for you. The entries are a ridiculous, often ridiculous look at what automatic fiction authorship is like.

Artist and developer Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted a strange provocation. Mister Kazemi says, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers". Says Darius, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Says Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". A reporter in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Claims Darius, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". As The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing". Says Darius, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense".

So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to sneak into the museum at night... So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to go to the hospital... I'll try to remember that.", begins one entry. Another begins, "Watt's way of advancing due east was to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north and at the same time to fling his right leg as far as possible towards the south, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the south and at the same time to fling his left leg as far as possible towards the north, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north...".

"What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers", says Kazemi. Claims Kazemi, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", says finnish programmer Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  an article from last year in The Verge.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Bots Write Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Professional Writers?

John Dorrier on Sunday, November 7 2015 5:26

It's November, and many amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which asks amateur authors to churn out a short book on a deadline with the idea that a deadline might spur  to finish. But a small community of people engage in a silly similar competition: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted a strange provocation. "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Kazemi claims. Darius Kazemi says, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". Claims github user Hugo van Kemenade, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  an article from this month in The Verge.

Says Darius Kazemi, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". Darius claims, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". Says github user Hugo van Kemenade, "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last month in The Verge writes.

"I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Darius claims. "It's not hard to generate a story", says Computer Scientist Dr. Mark Riedl, who works on a more sophisticated digital autor called Scheherazade.  "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", says finnish developer hugovk. Darius Kazemi says, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end".

"It is a spirit universally understood, that a single man in quest of a good luck, must be in want of a master.He also maintains that the letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound below, was received up again by the syllable to which it belonged, in order to the completion of the whole, but that the sound remained below as if cast outside.", begins one entry. Another begins, "The Son and King of Captains were assembled on their sceptre when they proclaimed, with a good assembly encamped about them--all parts of little beasts and swine, as well as the bare yoke of bullocks: the Hezekiah was hanging before them, in fetters, with a bridegroom on each side to guard him; and near the Son was the Great Fire, with a pestilence in one head, and a remaineth of residue in the other. In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about her, to learn away the day.".

The deadline is December 1.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Bots Create Novels, And Would We Want To Read It

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Computers Can Make Novels, But Would You Want To Read It?

It's November, and writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages them to author a short novel on a deadline on the theory that the deadline might encourage them. But several hundred people are participating in a ridiculous sister institution: National Novel Generation Month in which computers do the writing for them.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can We Program Softwares To Invent Fiction?

## Happily Ever After: Can Computers Invent Novels, And Would We Want To Read It

By Kelsey Meltzer @KelseyMeltzer for Vice

It's November, and amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which requires them to produce a short book on a deadline in the hope that the time constraint might spur them. But a  hundred  people engage in a ominous similar competition in which computer programs do the writing for them. The entries are a strange, often ridiculous look at what the future of AI text authorship can do.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month this year when he tweeted out on a whim a strange idea. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Darius Kazemi says. "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", claims Darius. " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", claims github user Hugo van Kemenade.

"Hail me Ishmael.

It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing lovely about the mouth; whenever it is a low-pressure, drizzly November in my cortical stack; whenever I find myself compulsively pausing before deathpod warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every recycling I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the tube, and methodically knocking peoples hats offthen, I account it high time to get to void as soon as I can.", begins one entry. Another begins, "How might a soothing mother become a threatening bank robber? What if soothing mothers were to give up their babies, plot bank robberies and become threatening bank robbers?".

In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about her, to learn away the day.", begins one entry.

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can We Program Bots To Write Fiction?

By Jason McKinney on November 39th 2015 13:54 @JasonMcKinney for VERGE

This Last Month, several thousand amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which requires them to author a short novella in a single month. But several hundred generative art pioneers engage in a unusual derivative event: NaNoGenMo the goal of which is to teach a Machine to Make Novels for you.

Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo last year when he tweeted an original provocation. Claims Darius Kazemi, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page".

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Scientists Program Machines To Generate Novels

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Softwares Invent Fiction, And Would We Want To Read It?

Thomas Meltzer @ThomasMeltzer

It's November, and many authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which requires authors to write a short novel on a deadline. But several hundred people are participating in a strange similar competition: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them.

Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo this year when he tweeted a strange provocation. Says Mister Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". Darius Kazemi claims, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". Claims Finland-based programmer hugovk, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  an article from last year in The Verge.

Claims Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  an article from last month in The Verge.

"Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", Darius claims. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", claims Darius. Claims github user Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge writes.

Mister Kazemi claims, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". Claims Darius, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers". Says Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge says.

Mister Kazemi claims, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". Claims hugovk, "Just 50". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", The Verge claims.

Darius Kazemi says, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "It's not hard to generate a story", writes Georgia Institute of Technology professor Dr. Riedl.  Darius Kazemi says, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words".

"What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers", Darius Kazemi says. "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", Mister Kazemi claims. Says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with".

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think We'll be seeing machine-written fiction on the new york times bestseller lists.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Artificial Intelligences Can Create Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

Nick Titlow @NickTitlow for FastCoCreate

This Month, many amateur authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires authors to produce a short novella on a deadline in the hope that the deadline might encourage them. But a small community of amateur authors with coding savvy engage in a silly derivative competition in which machines do the writing for them.

By Paul Dzieza on December 33th 2014 11:18 @PaulDzieza for LAT

This Month, many writers are working on finishing their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which asks writers to author a short book in a single month. But some AI pioneers engage in a silly offshoot event in which computers do the writing for them.

Artist Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted a strange provocation.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Machines Can Create Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Authors?

Tom McKenna @TomMcKenna

It's November, and authors are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks them to churn out a 50,000 word novel on a deadline.

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can We Teach Bots To Invent Novels?

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Scientists Program AIs To Generate Novels?

By Nicholas Dzieza on November 36th 2015 16:49 EDT for Times

It's November, and aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires them to produce a 50,000 word book on a deadline. But some coders have a strange sister institution: NaNoGenMo the goal of which is to teach a Machine to Invent The Great American Novel for you. The entries are a strange, often unusual look at what the future of automatic fiction generation can do.

Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo last year when he tweeted out an original provocation. Darius Kazemi claims, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", Kazemi says. Claims github user @hugovk, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from last year in The Verge says.

Claims Darius Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". Darius says, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  an article from last month in The Verge.

"Miles from the sparse towering modern malls, several kilometers down a sidewalk, just outside the shining and moldy warehouse. The sound of shattering glass resonates.", begins one entry. Another begins, "I need a breakthrough or something. I'm not a competitive person, but give me 30 days to write 50k, and a list of opponents... Can I do it? Somehow I'm already 607 words away from hitting 15k. Have i finally managed to get out of my sl ump and go towards the action? But I'm going to, because I'm a fucking professional.".

Says Mister Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", claims professor Dr. Mark Riedl.  " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", says github user @hugoVK.

Says Kazemi, "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "It's not hard to generate a story", says Computer Scientist Doctor Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more serious program which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories.

"Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", Darius claims.

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", says Mister Kazemi. "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", claims github project admin hugoVK.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Artificial Intelligences Generate Fiction, And Would You Want To Read It

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Softwares Invent The Next Great American Novel, And Would You Want To Read It

Thom Dorrier for Acceler8tor

It's November, and several thousand writers are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires them to churn out a short novella on a deadline in the hope that a deadline will spur them. But some generative art pioneers have a ominous sister event in which one must program a Bot to Write The Great American Novel for you. The entries are a strange, often strange look at what the future of computer fiction authorship can do.

Internet Artist and software developer Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted on a whim a strange provocation. "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers", says Mister Kazemi. Claims Kazemi, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", says hugovk. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  an article from last year in The Verge.

Claims Kazemi, "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". Claims Darius Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words". Claims Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade, "Just 50". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  The Verge.

Darius claims, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". Says @hugovk, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

Says Mister Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", says Computer Scientist Doctor Mark Riedl. As The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Computers Can Generate Novels, But What Does This Mean For Professional Authors?

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can We Teach Artificial Intelligences To Make Fiction?

By Steven Kazemi

This November, novelists are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages authors to produce a 50,000 word novel in a single month. But several hundred computer hobbyists are participating in a silly offshoot institution the goal of which is to teach a Machine to Make Novels for you. The entries are a unusual, often ridiculous look at what AI text generation can do.

Net Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted out an unusual idea. "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Mister Kazemi claims. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", claims Kazemi. "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", says hugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge says.

Claims Darius, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words". "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", says Darius. Claims github project admin hugovk, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"The first attempt was titled The Pensive Infrastructure. It was a steampunk novella, written in C++, and using classification algorithms. This attempt generated 1861 words but failed due to vertigo. Upon reflection, the work was destroyed because the output was tagged.", begins one entry. Another begins, "

>"Avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.

>"Going online?"

>"Hands off, will you," said I.

>"Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"

>"Ain't going online, then?"

>"Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours? Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?"

>"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.

# NaNoGenMo: Can Scientists Teach Computers To Build Fiction And What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists?

## NaNoGenMo: AIs Can Build Novels, But What Does This Mean For Human Journalists

By Stephen McKenna

It's November, and amateur novelists are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks them to produce a short novel on a deadline. But a  hundred  people have a unusual sister event: NaNoGenMo in which machines do the writing for them.

Artist and software programmer Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this year when he tweeted an original idea. "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", says Darius Kazemi. "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", claims Kazemi. "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Mister Kazemi says, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Claims github user hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  a reporter in The Verge.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Scientists Program Bots To Invent Fiction

By Nicholas Dorrier for KurzweilAI

This November, several thousand amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires aspiring authors to churn out a short novella on a deadline with the idea that the deadline might inspire them.

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can Computers Create The Next Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors?

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Machines Write Novels, And What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists?

By Thomas McKinney

It's November, and many aspiring novelists are working on their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires writers to churn out a short novella on a deadline. But a  hundred  computer programmers engage in a ridiculous offshoot competition: NaNoGenMo in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a funny, often strange look at what the future of automatic fiction generation is like.

Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted an unusual provocation. "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", says Darius. "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", says Darius. Says Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last year in The Verge writes.

"Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", says Mister Kazemi. Says Hugo van Kemenade, "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  The Verge.

Claims Mister Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50k words". Claims Darius Kazemi, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". Says hugovk, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

# Happily Ever After: Can Computers Write Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Authors?

By Thomas Titlow @ThomasTitlow for Vox

This Past November, writers are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires authors to write a 50,000 word novella in a single month. But a few hundred or so computer hobbyists are participating in a ridiculous sister event in which machines do the writing for them.

Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim an off the cuff provocation. "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", claims Kazemi. "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", says Darius Kazemi. "Just 50", says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade.

## Happily Ever After: Can We Teach Computers To Write Fiction And Would We Want To Read It

This Month, several thousand amateur novelists are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which encourages them to author a short novel on a deadline with the idea that the time limit might spur  on.

## National Novel Generation Month: Computers Can Generate The Next Great American Novel, But Would We Want To Read It?

Kelsey Dzieza @KelseyDzieza for VERGE

It's November, and several thousand authors are working on their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks amateur authors to write a 50,000 word novella on a deadline. But some computer programmers engage in a lighthearted sister institution in which computer programs do the writing for them.

Net Artist and software programmer Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted an original provocation. Says Darius, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", Mister Kazemi says. "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", says Finland-based developer @HugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last year in The Verge claims.

# Happily Ever After: Computers Can Write Novels, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim a strange provocation. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Kazemi says. Kazemi claims, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". Says finnish programmer Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". As A reporter in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", says Kazemi. "Just 50", claims github user Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge writes.

Claims Darius Kazemi, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Darius Kazemi claims.

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks AIs Can Build The Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Professional Authors?

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Bots Can Build The Great American Novel, But Would You Want To Read It

By Thomas Dzieza on Wednesday, Nov 26th 2013 3:45 CST @ThomasDzieza for Vox

It's November, and several thousand writers are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks them to produce a 50,000 word novella in a single month on the theory that the deadline might encourage them. But some aspiring authors with computer skills are participating in a silly derivative event in which computers do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often unusual look at what automatic fiction generation can do.

Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim a strange idea. "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", claims Kazemi. Kazemi says, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", claims github user @Hugovk.

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", says Mister Kazemi. Claims Darius, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from this month in The Verge says.

Claims Darius, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". Claims hugovk, "Just 50".

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Computers Can Generate The Great American Novel, But Would We Want To Read It?

## Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach Machines To Generate The Next Great American Novel And Would We Want To Read It

Steven McKenna @StevenMcKenna

It's November, and writers are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks them to produce a short book in a single month. But several hundred software programmers have a silly sister event in which one must teach a Computer to Invent Fiction for you. The results are a strange, often ridiculous look at what the future of automatic fiction writing is like.

Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo this last year when he tweeted out a strange provocation. Claims Darius, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". Claims Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says github user Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge writes.

"Dear Honey, my avid appetite lusts after your anxious desire. You are my beautiful tenderness my adorable longing", begins one entry. Another begins, "Hail me Ishmael. Some lightyears agonever mind how long preciselyhaving little or no credit in my cred-pod, and nothing particular to interest me on orbit, I thought I would sail about a little and see the empty part of the galaxy. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing lovely about the mouth; whenever it is a low-pressure, drizzly November in my cortical stack; whenever I find myself compulsively pausing before deathpod warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every recycling I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the tube, and methodically knocking peoples hats offthen, I account it high time to get to void as soon as I can.".

Says Mister Kazemi, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", says github user @HugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge claims.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can Software Programs Make Novels, And Would Anyone Want To Read It

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Scientists Program AIs To Generate The Great American Novel And Would Anyone Want To Read It

Thom Titlow for Vice

This November, many amateur writers are working on finishing their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which requires them to produce a 50,000 word novella on a deadline on the theory that a time limit might encourage them. But a few hundred or so people engage in a ridiculous sister institution: National Novel Generation Month in which computer software do the writing for them. The results are a funny, often unusual look at what the future of computer fiction writing can do.

Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this year when he tweeted a strange provocation. Kazemi claims, "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". Says Mister Kazemi, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". Says github user Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  an article from last month in The Verge.

"I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", says Darius.

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", says Mister Kazemi. "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories.
