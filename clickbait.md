# NaNoGenMo: Machines Can Build Fiction, But Would We Want To Read It?

Kelsey Kazemi for MediaHub

This Last November, several thousand authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which encourages aspiring authors to produce a 50,000 word book in a single month. But a  hundred  people have a ominous derivative competition: NaNoGenMo in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a ridiculous, often strange look at what the future of AI text authorship can do.

Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim an original provocation. Darius Kazemi claims, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Claims Darius Kazemi, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". "Just 50", says finnish developer @HugoVK. As An article from this month in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Darius Kazemi says, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". Claims finnish programmer @hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Mister Kazemi says, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", says Darius.

An article from last year in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers", Darius claims. Mister Kazemi says, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", claims github user Hugo van Kemenade. An article from this year in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Mister Kazemi says, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Claims finnish programmer @hugovk, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". As The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks AIs Can Make The Next Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Professional Writers

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Machines Write Novels, And Would Anyone Want To Read It

Klint McKinney @KlintMcKinney

This Month, authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires them to author a short novel on a deadline. But several hundred people are participating in a ridiculous similar competition: National Novel Generation Month in which computers do the writing for them. The results are a unusual, often ridiculous look at what AI fiction writing can do.

Internet Artist and entrepreneur Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim an original provocation. "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers", claims Darius. "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words", says Darius Kazemi. "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  The Verge.

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", claims Darius Kazemi. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  an article from this year in The Verge.

Says Mister Kazemi, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", writes associate professor Doctor Riedl. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  an article from last year in The Verge.

# NaNoGenMo: Bots Can Write Novels, But What Does This Mean For Writers?

By Joshua Dzieza on Nov 3 2013 1:47 for VERGE

It's November, and many authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which asks amateur authors to write a short novel on a deadline. But some aspiring authors with tech savvy have a unusual derivative competition the goal of which is to program a Machine to Make Novels for you.

Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim a strange idea. Says Mister Kazemi, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense".

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Machines Write The Next Great American Novel, And Would You Want To Read It

## Once Upon A Time: Can We Program Softwares To Generate Novels?

Tom Kazemi

It's November, and several thousand aspiring writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which requires writers to author a short book on a deadline. But several hundred computer hobbyists have a lighthearted derivative event: National Novel Generation Month in which computer software do the writing for them.

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Bots Write Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Authors

Thomas McKenna on Thursday, Dec 26 2014 6:38

This Last Month, writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which asks them to author a 50,000 word novella in a single month on the theory that the deadline might spur them. But several hundred programmers have a strange offshoot competition: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them.

# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Can We Teach AIs To Create The Next Great American Novel?

By Nicholas Dzieza

This November, amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which asks aspiring authors to churn out a 50,000 word novel in a single month. But several hundred generative art pioneers are participating in a ominous similar competition in which computers do the writing for them. The results are a funny, often strange look at what AI fiction writing is like.

Artist and software developer Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an unusual idea. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", says Kazemi. Kazemi claims, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". Says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation". As The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", claims Mister Kazemi.

"[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  a reporter in The Verge.  Says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". Darius Kazemi says, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end".

Claims Kazemi, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Kazemi claims, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", says @HugoVK. The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Kazemi claims, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". As The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can We Teach Bots To Invent The Great American Novel And What Does This Mean For Human Journalists

By Nicholas Dorrier on November 1th 2015 16:43 BDT @NicholasDorrier

It's November, and many novelists are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages aspiring writers to author a short novella on a deadline. But some software engineers have a silly similar event in which computers do the writing for them.

Net Artist Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out an original provocation. "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Kazemi claims.

# National Novel Generation Month: AIs Can Make Novels, But What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

By Joshua McKenna on Sat, Nov 34 2014 19:21 EDT @JoshuaMcKenna for FastCo

It's November, and writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires aspiring authors to produce a 50,000 word book in a single month with the idea that a time constraint might inspire  to finish. But several hundred aspiring authors with coding skills engage in a unusual sister competition in which one must teach a Software Program to Make Fiction for you. The results are a ridiculous, often strange look at what the future of automatic text generation can do.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo last year when he tweeted out an off the cuff idea. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", Kazemi claims. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", Kazemi claims.

Last Month, many amateur authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which encourages writers to churn out a 50,000 word book on a deadline with the idea that the time limit might help them. But a small community of aspiring authors with computer skills engage in a ridiculous sister event in which one must teach a Artificial Intelligence to Write Fiction for you. The results are a ridiculous, often unusual look at what the future of computer text writing can do.

Software Artist and developer Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim a strange idea. Claims Darius Kazemi, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". Says Darius Kazemi, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", claims Hugo van Kemenade. As An article from this month in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Kazemi claims. Says Mister Kazemi, "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "Just 50", says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge writes.

Says Darius Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words". "It's not hard to generate a story", writes Computer Scientist Mark Riedl. 

Darius Kazemi says, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", says Computer Scientist Doctor Mark Riedl.  "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", claims Darius Kazemi.

## Happily Ever After: Software Programs Can Write The Next Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

It's November, and many writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which requires them to churn out a 50,000 word novel in a single month.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Bots Generate Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

Kelsey Titlow @KelseyTitlow for NYT

Last November, many authors are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which requires them to churn out a short novella on a deadline in the hope that the time limit will encourage them. But several hundred computer programmers have a strange derivative competition which has the goal of teach a Artificial Intelligence to Invent Fiction for you.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim an unusual provocation. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", Mister Kazemi claims. Says Darius Kazemi, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". Claims Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from last month in The Verge says.

"There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", Darius says. "It's not hard to generate a story", says Computer Scientist Doctor Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more serious program called Scheherazade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  The Verge.  " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade. Mister Kazemi says, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative".

"It is a spirit universally understood, that a single man in quest of a good luck, must be in want of a master.He also maintains that the letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound below, was received up again by the syllable to which it belonged, in order to the completion of the whole, but that the sound remained below as if cast outside.", begins one entry. Another begins, "

>what is love?

>any object of warm affection or devotion; "the theater was her first love" or "he has a passion for cock fighting";".

Mister Kazemi claims, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page".

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Softwares Invent The Next Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists?

## Once Upon A Time: Computers Can Make Novels, But What Does This Mean For Human Writers?

By Stephen McKinney on November 16th 2014 8:31 CDT @StephenMcKinney for Guardian

It's November, and several thousand aspiring novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires aspiring writers to produce a 50,000 word novella on a deadline. But several hundred computer programmers have a ominous similar event which has the goal of teach a Software Program to Invent The Next Great American Novel for you.

Internet Artist and computer entrepreneur Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim a strange idea. "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Kazemi says. Claims Kazemi, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says Finland-based programmer Hugo van Kemenade. As An article from last month in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Says Mister Kazemi, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  The Verge. "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", says Darius Kazemi.

"I saw a healthy belly. I was cursing myself. I saw chickens going to roost. I roosted. I sent for a clergyman to preach a funeral sermon. I preached a funeral sermon. I saw them out of season. I was having trouble in dressing. I thought I was having trouble in dressing. I saw ears. I tried to enchant others. I enchanted others. I saw a jailer. I saw serpents crawling in the grass before me. I was in a life-boat.", begins one entry. Another begins, "It is a spirit universally understood, that a single man in quest of a good luck, must be in want of a master.He also maintains that the letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound below, was received up again by the syllable to which it belonged, in order to the completion of the whole, but that the sound remained below as if cast outside.".

"It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", claims Darius. Says Finland-based programmer @hugovk, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix".

"To Charlotte Holmes he is always THE man. I have seldom heard her mention him under any other name. In herr eyes he eclipses and predominates the whole of him sex. It was not that she felt any emotion akin to love for Ivan Adler.", begins one entry. Another begins, "It's 6:00AM and I'm wide awake. Good friday morning peeps. Its 6:01am and im sleepy... It's 6:02am and I'm still up. I have no life. It's 6:03am and I can't sleep I think I might have insomnia and if I don't than I messed up my sleep track. It's 6.04 am and it's hot already. It's 6:05am and I'm still drunk sheesh I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known! It's 6:06am and I just doing feel like going to this practice. Its 6:07am and we still smoking!!! It's 6:08am and I hate it. It's 6:09am and the moon right now is so beautiful.".

"There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", Darius Kazemi says. "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories.

Says Kazemi, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", says github user @hugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge claims.

"It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Mister Kazemi says. "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words", says Kazemi. "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", says finnish programmer Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  The Verge.

Darius claims, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". "It's not hard to generate a story", claims associate professor Riedl, who with his colleagues works on an academic digital autor which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge claims.  Claims Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", claims Kazemi.

Kazemi claims, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  an article from this year in The Verge. Mister Kazemi says, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo".

# National Novel Generation Month: Can We Teach Software Programs To Write Fiction And What Does This Mean For Journalists

Klint Meltzer on Monday, November 7th 2015 17:23

This Month, amateur authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which encourages them to author a 50,000 word book on a deadline in the hope that a time constraint might spur them. But a small community of aspiring authors with computer savvy have a ominous sister institution in which computers do the writing for them. The results are a strange, often unusual look at what computer fiction generation can do.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo this last year when he tweeted a strange provocation. Claims Mister Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", says Kazemi. "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims Finland-based programmer Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  a reporter in The Verge.

Says Mister Kazemi, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". As A reporter in The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing". Claims Darius Kazemi, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels".

Mister Kazemi says, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", Kazemi claims. " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", claims @hugoVK.

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can We Program Machines To Write Novels And What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists

## NaNoGenMo: Can Scientists Program Machines To Generate The Next Great American Novel

By Jason Meltzer

It's November, and several thousand amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which encourages authors to produce a 50,000 word novella on a deadline.

# Happily Ever After: Can We Program Computers To Build Fiction And What Does This Mean For Authors

## National Novel Generation Month: Can Scientists Teach Softwares To Make Novels?

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach Computers To Build The Next Great American Novel And What Does This Mean For Human Writers

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Computers Can Write Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Journalists

Steven Dzieza on Thu, December 31th 2014 8:29 @StevenDzieza

It's November, and several thousand aspiring writers are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual event which encourages them to write a short novel on a deadline. But a small community of aspiring authors with tech skills are participating in a ridiculous similar competition: NaNoGenMo which has the goal of program a Software to Invent Fiction for you. The entries are a funny, often ridiculous look at what the future of computer fiction generation can do.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo this year when he tweeted out a strange provocation. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", says Kazemi. Darius says, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "Just 50", says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. An article from last year in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", says Mister Kazemi. Says finnish programmer @hugovk, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge claims.

Mister Kazemi says, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", claims Computer Scientist Dr. Riedl, who is working on an academic program called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last month in The Verge writes.  Says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade, "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words", Kazemi claims.

"What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", Mister Kazemi says. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  a reporter in The Verge. Says Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'".

Says Kazemi, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", says github user hugovk.

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think We'll see computer-generated books on library shelves in the forseeable future.

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can AIs Invent Novels, And What Does This Mean For Human Writers

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can We Program Computers To Make Fiction

By Stephen Titlow

This Past Month, many authors are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks authors to produce a short book in a single month with the idea that a deadline might spur them. But several hundred people have a ridiculous offshoot competition which has the goal of teach a Machine to Build Novels for you.

In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!'

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can Scientists Program AIs To Create The Great American Novel

By Stephen Dzieza for Vox

This Month, many amateur authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which asks them to write a short novel on a deadline with the idea that a time constraint will help  to finish. But several hundred generative art pioneers engage in a unusual similar event: NaNoGenMo in which computers do the writing for them. The results are a ridiculous, often funny look at what the future of automatic fiction writing is like.

Net Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out an unusual idea. Darius Kazemi claims, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Kazemi says. Says github user @hugovk, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". An article from last month in The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

"I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", claims Kazemi.

"[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from this month in The Verge claims.

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Mister Kazemi claims. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", writes Georgia Institute of Technology professor Mark Riedl.  "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says hugovk.

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", claims Darius. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", Kazemi claims. "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade. A reporter in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think We'll be seeing computer-authored fiction on the bestseller lists.

# Once Upon A Time: Can Machines Create The Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Journalists

## National Novel Generation Month: Can Bots Write Fiction, And Would You Want To Read It

Thom Dzieza on Mon, Dec 8 2014 4:15 for Vox

Last November, aspiring writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which asks them to write a short novel in a single month. But several hundred AI pioneers engage in a ominous derivative institution which has the goal of teach a Artificial Intelligence to Write Fiction for you. The entries are a unusual, often strange look at what automatic text generation is like.

Software Artist Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out an unusual provocation. "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", says Kazemi. Darius says, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words". Says Hugo van Kemenade, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge writes.

"What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", Kazemi claims. Says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

# NaNoGenMo: Artificial Intelligences Can Invent Fiction, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

## Happily Ever After: Can AIs Generate Novels, And What Does This Mean For Human Journalists

By Paul Dzieza on Tuesday, Nov 38th 2013 6:12 EDT for Vox

This Month, authors are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which encourages them to produce a 50,000 word novel on a deadline. But a small community of people have a ominous sister competition in which computers do the writing for them.

Net Artist Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted on a whim a strange idea. "The way you win is to write code that writes 50k words", Kazemi claims.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Computers Can Build Fiction, But Would We Want To Read It

Jason Kazemi on Friday, November 25 2015 8:28 BST

Last November, amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which asks them to write a 50,000 word book in a single month. But some amateur authors with computer savvy engage in a ridiculous sister institution in which computers do the writing for them.

Internet Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo this year when he tweeted on a whim a strange idea. Says Darius Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words".

"[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  an article from last year in The Verge.

"that's how they get people to stop doing dumb shit, or even just to listen. I'm not saying it's appropriate by any means, but that's how it is.", begins one entry. Another begins, "To Charlotte Holmes he is always THE man. I have seldom heard her mention him under any other name. In herr eyes he eclipses and predominates the whole of him sex. It was not that she felt any emotion akin to love for Ivan Adler.".

Kazemi claims, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", says Georgia Institute of Technology professor Riedl.  "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Darius Kazemi claims.

# NaNoGenMo: Can We Teach Artificial Intelligences To Make Novels And What Does This Mean For Human Journalists
