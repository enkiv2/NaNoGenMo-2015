# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Can Artificial Intelligences Invent Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Human Authors

By Joshua Dzieza on Fri, Dec 34th 2014 7:21 EST @JoshuaDzieza for Motherboard

It's November, and several thousand writers are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires them to churn out a short book on a deadline on the theory that a time constraint might inspire  on. But a small community of amateur authors with programming skills engage in a lighthearted offshoot competition: NaNoGenMo in which computer programs do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often unusual look at what the future of automatic text authorship is like.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted out on a whim a strange provocation. "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Kazemi says. Claims Darius, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says @HugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  The Verge.

Claims Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", writes Georgia Institute of Technology professor Dr. Riedl.  "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", claims github project admin @hugoVK.

# National Novel Generation Month: Software Programs Can Create Novels, But Would You Want To Read It?

By Paul Kazemi on November 17 2014 8:56 @PaulKazemi

This November, several thousand amateur authors are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks them to author a short book in a single month on the theory that the deadline will inspire  on.

The entries are a unusual, often unusual look at what the future of AI fiction generation is like.

Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo this year when he tweeted an off the cuff idea. Claims Darius, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo".

# Happily Ever After: Can Computers Build Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Human Authors

Nicholas McKenna on November 6 2013 17:39 PST @NicholasMcKenna

It's November, and several thousand novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages writers to churn out a 50,000 word novel on a deadline. But several hundred aspiring authors with programming skills are participating in a unusual similar event: National Novel Generation Month the goal of which is to program a Machine to Write Fiction for you.

Software Artist Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted out an off the cuff provocation. Claims Darius Kazemi, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Kazemi says. Says github user @hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". An article from last month in The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Darius Kazemi says, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". "Just 50", says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", The Verge claims.

"The way you win is to write code that writes 50k words", Darius claims. Claims Mister Kazemi, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". Claims Hugo van Kemenade, "Just 50". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  an article from this month in The Verge.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can We Teach Machines To Generate The Great American Novel?

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Artificial Intelligences Can Generate The Next Great American Novel, But Would You Want To Read It

By Klint Dzieza for ABC

Last November, several thousand amateur writers are working on finishing their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages them to write a 50,000 word novella on a deadline. But several hundred AI pioneers are participating in a unusual derivative event in which machines do the writing for them. The entries are a ridiculous, often strange look at what AI fiction writing is like.

Software Artist and entrepreneur Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted an off the cuff provocation. Says Darius Kazemi, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Darius says. Says Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", The Verge claims.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can We Program Softwares To Create Novels And What Does This Mean For Human Journalists?

Jason Dorrier on Dec 33 2013 16:52 for Guardian

It's November, and novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which requires them to write a short novella in a single month. But some computer programmers have a lighthearted sister event: National Novel Generation Month in which one must program a AI to Write The Next Great American Novel for you. The results are a funny, often ridiculous look at what the future of computer text authorship is like.

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Bots Build The Next Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

# Once Upon A Time: Can AIs Build The Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

By Jason McKenna on Weds, Nov 34th 2015 2:57 EST for Vice

It's November, and amateur writers are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires authors to produce a short novella in a single month with the idea that the deadline will spur  to finish. But a  hundred  computer hobbyists engage in a lighthearted offshoot competition the goal of which is to teach a Software to Invent Fiction for you.

Internet Artist and entrepreneur Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month this year when he tweeted out on a whim an original idea.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Machines Can Generate The Next Great American Novel, But Would We Want To Read It

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Computers Can Make Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Professional Writers

By Thom Dzieza @ThomDzieza for FastCompany

Last November, several thousand amateur writers are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages amateur writers to produce a short novel on a deadline. But a few hundred or so coders engage in a strange offshoot competition which has the goal of teach a Artificial Intelligence to Create The Next Great American Novel for you. The results are a ridiculous, often strange look at what AI text writing can do.

Internet Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an unusual provocation. "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", claims Kazemi. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Kazemi claims. "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", says finnish developer Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  a reporter in The Verge.

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", says Darius Kazemi. Says github user @hugovk, "Just 50". An article from last month in The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Claims Mister Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from this year in The Verge claims.

Mister Kazemi says, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", says Computer Scientist Riedl.  Says github user hugovk, "Just 50". "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", claims Darius.

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Scientists Program Bots To Invent The Great American Novel And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors?

Josh Meltzer on Fri, November 31th 2014 19:28 BDT @JoshMeltzer

Last November, novelists are working on finishing their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages them to churn out a short novella in a single month on the theory that a time constraint will help  to finish. But a small community of AI pioneers engage in a ridiculous derivative competition in which machines do the writing for them.

Internet Artist Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted out on a whim an unusual idea. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", Kazemi says. Darius says, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". Says finnish programmer Hugo van Kemenade, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  an article from this month in The Verge.

Claims Mister Kazemi, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". Claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". A reporter in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

"I need a breakthrough or something. I'm not a competitive person, but give me 30 days to write 50k, and a list of opponents... Can I do it? Somehow I'm already 607 words away from hitting 15k. Have i finally managed to get out of my sl ump and go towards the action? But I'm going to, because I'm a fucking professional.", begins one entry. Another begins, "To Charlotte Holmes he is always THE man. I have seldom heard her mention him under any other name. In herr eyes he eclipses and predominates the whole of him sex. It was not that she felt any emotion akin to love for Ivan Adler.".

Claims Darius Kazemi, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". Claims github user @hugovk, "Just 50". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  The Verge.

Mister Kazemi says, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", claims Computer Scientist Mark Riedl, who with his colleagues works on an academic digital story generator which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories about, say, going to the movies.  "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says finnish programmer @Hugovk. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", Darius Kazemi claims.

Claims Mister Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'".

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Scientists Teach Computers To Build Fiction

By John Meltzer on Nov 17 2013 11:31 for SingularityHub

It's November, and many aspiring writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires amateur writers to author a short novella on a deadline with the idea that a deadline might spur  on. But some computer hobbyists have a strange offshoot competition in which computer programs do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often strange look at what the future of AI text generation can do.

Software Artist and software developer Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo this last year when he tweeted on a whim an original provocation. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", says Kazemi. Says Darius, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says github user hugovk. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

"The world has always been a baren wasteland full of vicious monsters and very few survivors. Our story will follow that of a young lady.", begins one entry. Another begins, "But I hope you willl get ovaaa it, whereby live to see manyy young snowmobilers ofthe four karat a yearrr comeeee into tje neighbourhood.".

Darius claims, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Says hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". A reporter in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", claims Kazemi. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  The Verge. Mister Kazemi claims, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people".

"Miles from the sparse towering modern malls, several kilometers down a sidewalk, just outside the shining and moldy warehouse. The sound of shattering glass resonates.", begins one entry. Another begins, "The first attempt was titled The Pensive Infrastructure. It was a steampunk novella, written in C++, and using classification algorithms. This attempt generated 1861 words but failed due to vertigo. Upon reflection, the work was destroyed because the output was tagged.".

Says Darius Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", claims Kazemi. Claims Finland-based developer hugovk, "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  The Verge.

"It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", says Darius Kazemi. "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", says Computer Scientist Dr. Mark Riedl, who with his colleagues works on a more sophisticated digital storyteller called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

This Month, amateur authors are working on finishing their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages writers to write a 50,000 word novella on a deadline.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks AIs Can Create The Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Human Journalists

## Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach Artificial Intelligences To Build Fiction And Would We Want To Read It

Klint McKinney @KlintMcKinney

This Last Month, several thousand amateur authors are working on their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which encourages authors to produce a short novel on a deadline in the hope that a deadline will encourage them. But a small community of computer programmers engage in a ridiculous similar institution in which machines do the writing for them.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim a strange idea.

It's November, and many novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks authors to produce a short novel in a single month on the theory that the time constraint might help them.

# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Can Software Programs Generate Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can We Teach Artificial Intelligences To Invent The Next Great American Novel?

Kelsey Titlow

Last November, several thousand writers are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires them to author a 50,000 word book on a deadline. But some people engage in a ridiculous derivative institution in which one must program a AI to Generate The Great American Novel for you. The entries are a unusual, often ridiculous look at what AI text generation can do.

Artist and developer Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out an unusual provocation. Mister Kazemi says, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". Kazemi says, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says finnish developer Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from this month in The Verge writes.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can We Program Software Programs To Invent Novels And Would You Want To Read It?

By Josh Dzieza on December 37th 2015 3:23 CDT @JoshDzieza for Vox

It's November, and aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which encourages them to write a short novel on a deadline.

# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Can We Program Machines To Create Novels And Would We Want To Read It

## NaNoGenMo: Can We Teach Artificial Intelligences To Generate Novels And What Does This Mean For Human Authors

By Thomas Dorrier for NBC

This Last Month, many aspiring novelists are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks authors to author a 50,000 word novella in a single month with the idea that the deadline might help them. But several hundred computer hobbyists are participating in a unusual similar competition in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a unusual, often funny look at what AI fiction writing can do.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Artificial Intelligences Can Make The Next Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Software Programs Can Create Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Writers?

By Kelsey McKinney

Last November, several thousand amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages them to produce a short novel in a single month with the idea that a time limit will inspire  on. But a  hundred  engineers have a ridiculous offshoot event: NaNoGenMo in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a funny, often strange look at what AI text generation is like.

Artist and developer Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo last year when he tweeted out on a whim an off the cuff idea. "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", Darius says. Claims Darius, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". Says github user Hugo van Kemenade, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge claims.

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Machines Write Novels, And What Does This Mean For Human Authors?

## NaNoGenMo: Can Computers Create Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Authors

But a small community of generative art pioneers have a ominous similar competition: National Novel Generation Month which has the goal of teach a AI to Write Novels for you.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted an off the cuff provocation. "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", says Darius Kazemi. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Darius claims. "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge says.

"I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", says Darius Kazemi. "It's not hard to generate a story", claims Computer Scientist Doctor Mark Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more sophisticated digital autor which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge says. 

Darius claims, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

"What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers", Darius claims. "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", claims Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge writes.

Darius Kazemi claims, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", claims Georgia Institute of Technology associate professor Doctor Riedl.  Says Finland-based programmer Hugo van Kemenade, "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times".

"It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Kazemi says. Kazemi claims, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", says hugoVK. An article from this month in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

# NaNoGenMo: Can Scientists Program Artificial Intelligences To Write The Next Great American Novel

## National Novel Generation Month: AIs Can Build The Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists

By Klint Kazemi

This November, several thousand amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks them to churn out a short book on a deadline. But some software engineers have a ominous derivative institution in which computer programs do the writing for them. The results are a ridiculous, often ridiculous look at what automatic text authorship can do.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Softwares Can Create Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Human Journalists

It's November, and amateur novelists are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which encourages aspiring writers to churn out a short book in a single month in the hope that a time limit might encourage  on.

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach Softwares To Write The Great American Novel And What Does This Mean For Writers?
