# Once Upon A Time: Can Computers Build Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Professional Writers

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can Computers Make Novels, And What Does This Mean For Human Authors?

Thom McKinney @ThomMcKinney

Last Month, several thousand amateur authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires authors to churn out a short book on a deadline. But some people have a ominous derivative event in which computers do the writing for them. The results are a unusual, often ridiculous look at what AI fiction authorship is like.

Artist and developer Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an original idea. "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Mister Kazemi says. "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Darius Kazemi claims. " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", claims Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  The Verge.

"It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Darius Kazemi claims. "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. An article from this month in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Darius says, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end".

As A reporter in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"What if there was a banker who lost her bank and couldn't get money? But then she discovered that a robbery would solve her problem, so she forgot all about her old bank.", begins one entry. Another begins, "I need a breakthrough or something. I'm not a competitive person, but give me 30 days to write 50k, and a list of opponents... Can I do it? Somehow I'm already 607 words away from hitting 15k. Have i finally managed to get out of my sl ump and go towards the action? But I'm going to, because I'm a fucking professional.".

"It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", claims Darius. Says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade, "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times".

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think We'll be seeing computer-written fiction on the bestseller lists.

# NaNoGenMo: Can Computers Invent Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Human Authors?

## Happily Ever After: Can Softwares Generate Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Journalists

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can AIs Build Novels, And Would We Want To Read It

Stephen Titlow on Sat, December 32 2015 19:16

Last November, many aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which encourages aspiring authors to write a 50,000 word novella in a single month on the theory that a time constraint might help  to finish. But some aspiring authors with tech skills are participating in a unusual offshoot competition: NaNoGenMo the goal of which is to teach a Bot to Write Novels for you.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted out an original idea. Says Mister Kazemi, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". Darius Kazemi claims, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". Claims github user Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  The Verge.

# National Novel Generation Month: AIs Can Create Fiction, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

By Tom Kazemi for Vox

It's November, and several thousand amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages them to churn out a 50,000 word book on a deadline in the hope that the deadline might help them. But some AI pioneers are participating in a lighthearted similar competition: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them.

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Computers Can Build Novels, But What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists?

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Bots Can Create The Next Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Human Writers

By Klint Dorrier on Nov 19 2014 16:12 EDT for CBS

It's November, and amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages them to churn out a 50,000 word novella on a deadline with the idea that a deadline might encourage them. But a few hundred  generative art pioneers are participating in a unusual sister competition in which computers do the writing for them.

Artist Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted an off the cuff provocation. Kazemi claims, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". Darius Kazemi claims, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Claims github user Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull".

# NaNoGenMo: Can Scientists Program Machines To Create Fiction And Would Anyone Want To Read It

Thom Dzieza

It's November, and several thousand authors are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages them to write a short novella in a single month. But some software engineers are participating in a ominous derivative institution which has the goal of program a AI to Build Fiction for you.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo this last year when he tweeted on a whim an unusual idea. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Mister Kazemi says. Darius Kazemi claims, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". Says Hugo van Kemenade, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  a reporter in The Verge.

"I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", says Darius. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", says Kazemi. "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", claims @Hugovk. As An article from last month in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Mister Kazemi says. "It's not hard to generate a story", says professor Mark Riedl.

# Once Upon A Time: Can Scientists Teach Software Programs To Create The Great American Novel And Would You Want To Read It?

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Machines Generate Novels, And What Does This Mean For Writers

Thomas Meltzer on Wednesday, Dec 2 2015 13:53 BDT for Vox

Last November, many writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires them to churn out a 50,000 word novel in a single month. But a  hundred  aspiring authors with programming savvy have a strange derivative institution which has the goal of program a Bot to Invent The Great American Novel for you.

Artist and software entrepreneur Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an off the cuff idea. "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", claims Darius Kazemi. Says Darius Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims github user Hugo van Kemenade.

In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!'

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can We Teach Software Programs To Create Novels

## Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can Bots Generate Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Human Writers

By Steven McKenna on Sun, Nov 9th 2015 15:31 for Acceler8tor

Last Month, several thousand amateur writers are working on finishing their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires authors to produce a short novella on a deadline in the hope that a time limit might spur  on. But several hundred software coders have a lighthearted sister competition: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a ridiculous, often unusual look at what AI fiction generation can do.

Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo this last year when he tweeted out on a whim an unusual provocation. Says Darius Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Kazemi claims. Says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". A reporter in The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

"that's how they get people to stop doing dumb shit, or even just to listen. I'm not saying it's appropriate by any means, but that's how it is.", begins one entry. Another begins, "What if there was a banker who lost her bank and couldn't get money? But then she discovered that a robbery would solve her problem, so she forgot all about her old bank.".

"It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Kazemi claims. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", says professor Doctor Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more sophisticated digital autor which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts. 

Says Kazemi, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers". Darius says, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Says github project admin @hugovk, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  an article from this month in The Verge.

"What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers", says Darius Kazemi. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", says Mister Kazemi. "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", claims Finland-based programmer Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge claims.

Says Kazemi, "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". Darius claims, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", claims hugoVK.

"It's not hard to generate a story", says associate professor Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more serious program which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories about, say, going to the movies.  "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", says Hugo van Kemenade. "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", says Darius Kazemi.

"Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", Kazemi claims. "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", claims Darius. Claims Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade, "Just 50". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  The Verge.

# Once Upon A Time: Software Programs Can Invent Fiction, But Would We Want To Read It

## NaNoGenMo: Can We Program AIs To Make Novels

Steven Dorrier @StevenDorrier

It's November, and several thousand writers are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages them to produce a 50,000 word novella on a deadline in the hope that a deadline will inspire  on. But several hundred people are participating in a ridiculous sister competition: NaNoGenMo in which one must teach a Software Program to Make The Great American Novel for you. The entries are a unusual, often ridiculous look at what the future of automatic fiction generation can do.

Artist and developer Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted a strange idea. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Mister Kazemi says.

# National Novel Generation Month: Can We Program AIs To Invent Novels?

By Steven Dzieza @StevenDzieza for Vox

It's November, and amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which asks them to author a short book on a deadline with the idea that the time limit will inspire  to finish. But some software coders engage in a unusual derivative competition the goal of which is to teach a Bot to Invent Novels for you.

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Computers Write Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

## Happily Ever After: Bots Can Build The Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Journalists

By Jason McKenna @JasonMcKenna for VERGE

This Last November, many novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages writers to produce a 50,000 word novella on a deadline with the idea that the time limit will encourage them.

## National Novel Generation Month: Artificial Intelligences Can Generate The Next Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists

Klint Dzieza for FictionHub

It's November, and many amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks writers to author a 50,000 word book on a deadline. But several hundred computer hobbyists are participating in a ridiculous offshoot institution: National Novel Generation Month in which computer software do the writing for them.

# Once Upon A Time: Can We Teach Software Programs To Build Novels

Nicholas McKinney on Thursday, December 36th 2013 1:33 BDT for SingularityHub

It's November, and many aspiring novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages them to churn out a 50,000 word book on a deadline. But several hundred computer hobbyists are participating in a strange offshoot institution: National Novel Generation Month in which one must teach a Machine to Make Novels for you.

Artist Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted out on a whim a strange idea. Kazemi says, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". Claims Darius Kazemi, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims finnish programmer @HugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  a reporter in The Verge.

Mister Kazemi claims, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", claims hugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from this month in The Verge writes.

"There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", Darius claims. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge writes. Darius Kazemi says, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense".

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", says Darius Kazemi. "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", claims Computer Scientist Riedl, who is working on an academic digital autor called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories.  Claims Darius, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives".

The deadline is December 1st.

# NaNoGenMo: Can Artificial Intelligences Generate Novels, And Would You Want To Read It?

## Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Artificial Intelligences Can Build Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

By Josh Dzieza @JoshDzieza for FastCompany

Last November, amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires them to churn out a 50,000 word book on a deadline with the idea that a time limit might encourage  to finish. But some people are participating in a strange offshoot competition in which machines do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often ridiculous look at what the future of automatic fiction authorship can do.

Internet Artist and software developer Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month this year when he tweeted an unusual provocation. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", claims Darius Kazemi. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", says Mister Kazemi. Claims Hugo van Kemenade, "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times".

Claims Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". An article from this month in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing". "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", says Darius.

"It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Kazemi claims. Kazemi says, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". Says github user Hugo van Kemenade, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge writes.

Kazemi says, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "It's not hard to generate a story", says Georgia Institute of Technology associate professor Dr. Mark Riedl, who with his colleagues works on an academic digital story generator which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories.  "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Mister Kazemi claims.

In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!'

## Happily Ever After: Artificial Intelligences Can Build The Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Human Authors

By Tom Dorrier @TomDorrier for Vox

It's November, and several thousand authors are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks them to churn out a 50,000 word novel in a single month in the hope that the time limit might encourage  on. But some aspiring authors with tech savvy engage in a strange offshoot competition in which computers do the writing for them.

# Happily Ever After: Computers Can Invent The Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Kelsey McKenna @KelseyMcKenna

This Month, aspiring writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which encourages them to write a 50,000 word novel in a single month. But a  hundred  AI pioneers engage in a strange derivative event: National Novel Generation Month in which one must teach a Bot to Generate Novels for you.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted an off the cuff provocation. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", Darius Kazemi claims. Claims Kazemi, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". Claims finnish developer @hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". As The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Mister Kazemi claims, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". "It's not hard to generate a story", claims Computer Scientist Dr. Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more sophisticated program called Scheherazade. 

"The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", says Mister Kazemi. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", says Georgia Institute of Technology professor Mark Riedl.  Says Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull".

Kazemi says, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels".

# National Novel Generation Month: Can We Teach Artificial Intelligences To Invent The Great American Novel?

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach Machines To Create The Great American Novel?

By Josh Titlow

It's November, and many authors are working on their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires them to author a 50,000 word book in a single month with the idea that a time constraint might spur  to finish. But some amateur authors with programming savvy engage in a silly sister event in which machines do the writing for them.

Software Artist Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an unusual provocation. "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words", claims Darius. "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Kazemi claims. "Just 50", claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", The Verge claims.

"I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", says Darius Kazemi. "It's not hard to generate a story", says Computer Scientist Doctor Mark Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on an academic digital fiction generator called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts. 

"I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", says Darius.

"000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", claims github user @HugoVK.

"Watt's way of advancing due east was to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north and at the same time to fling his right leg as far as possible towards the south, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the south and at the same time to fling his left leg as far as possible towards the north, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north...", begins one entry. Another begins, "Hail me Ishmael. Some lightyears agonever mind how long preciselyhaving little or no credit in my cred-pod, and nothing particular to interest me on orbit, I thought I would sail about a little and see the empty part of the galaxy. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing lovely about the mouth; whenever it is a low-pressure, drizzly November in my cortical stack; whenever I find myself compulsively pausing before deathpod warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every recycling I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the tube, and methodically knocking peoples hats offthen, I account it high time to get to void as soon as I can.".

It's November, and many aspiring writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which asks them to write a 50,000 word novel in a single month on the theory that the deadline will spur them.

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Machines Write The Next Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Journalists?

Nick McKinney on Dec 26 2015 13:23 CDT @NickMcKinney

It's November, and several thousand amateur novelists are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires amateur authors to author a 50,000 word book on a deadline on the theory that a time limit might inspire  on. But a small community of computer hobbyists are participating in a lighthearted derivative competition: NaNoGenMo in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a funny, often ridiculous look at what automatic fiction writing can do.

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Computers Build The Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Professional Writers?

## Once Upon A Time: Can We Program Computers To Generate Fiction And What Does This Mean For Human Writers

Steven Dzieza @StevenDzieza for FastCoExist

This Month, several thousand aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages them to author a 50,000 word book on a deadline on the theory that the time constraint will encourage  on. But a few hundred or so AI pioneers engage in a ominous similar event: NaNoGenMo in which computer software do the writing for them.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted a strange provocation. Kazemi claims, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". Says Darius Kazemi, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page".

"It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Darius says. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", writes associate professor Doctor Riedl, who with his colleagues works on a more serious program called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts.  Says Darius, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative".

Claims Kazemi, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". Claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge claims.

# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks AIs Can Write The Next Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can We Program Softwares To Create Novels?

Thom McKinney @ThomMcKinney

It's November, and novelists are working on finishing their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires aspiring authors to write a short novel in a single month.

Last November, several thousand novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages them to author a 50,000 word book in a single month.

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Machines Build Novels, And Would Anyone Want To Read It

## Happily Ever After: Computers Can Build Novels, But Would You Want To Read It?

By Jason Meltzer for Fusion

It's November, and writers are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual event which encourages writers to churn out a 50,000 word book on a deadline. But some amateur authors with tech savvy have a strange derivative institution: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month this year when he tweeted on a whim a strange provocation. Kazemi claims, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". Claims Darius Kazemi, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". "Just 50", claims github user Hugo van Kemenade. The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Says Darius Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", claims Computer Scientist Mark Riedl, who is working on a more serious program. 

"The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", claims Mister Kazemi. Says @hugovk, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length". An article from this year in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Claims Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". Says Darius Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", says Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  The Verge.

Claims Mister Kazemi, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last year in The Verge writes. Claims Darius, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head".

"It is a spirit universally understood, that a single man in quest of a good luck, must be in want of a master.He also maintains that the letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound below, was received up again by the syllable to which it belonged, in order to the completion of the whole, but that the sound remained below as if cast outside.", begins one entry. Another begins, "

>Ingredients:

>>60 grams of rice

>>900 milligrams of creme pie

>>720 grams of cornmeal

>Method:

>> Set aside the rice and duck until soggy. Blend the creme pie and peach for 50 minutes. Shallow fry the grape soda and cornmeal until shiny. Force the ingredients into a mould shaped like a diamond. Serve.".

"The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", Mister Kazemi says. "It's not hard to generate a story", claims professor Riedl, who works on a more serious program which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories.  "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", says Mister Kazemi."There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", says Darius. " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", says Finland-based developer hugoVK. A reporter in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica"."How might a soothing mother become a threatening bank robber? What if soothing mothers were to give up their babies, plot bank robberies and become threatening bank robbers?", begins one entry.

This Month, many amateur writers are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which asks writers to write a short novella in a single month.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can We Teach AIs To Write Novels And Would You Want To Read It?

By Paul McKinney on Sun, December 1th 2013 15:41 EDT @PaulMcKinney

It's November, and many writers are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which asks writers to produce a short novella in a single month on the theory that the time constraint will help  on. But several hundred software programmers have a unusual derivative institution: NaNoGenMo in which one must teach a Machine to Generate The Next Great American Novel for you. The entries are a funny, often strange look at what the future of computer text authorship is like.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo last year when he tweeted on a whim an unusual provocation. "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Darius says.

# NaNoGenMo: Can Machines Build Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors?

## NaNoGenMo: Can We Program AIs To Build Novels?

Tom Titlow on Tues, December 2th 2013 15:28 @TomTitlow

This November, aspiring novelists are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which asks them to write a short novella in a single month. But a few hundred  AI pioneers are participating in a silly derivative event: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often unusual look at what automatic fiction authorship can do.

Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim a strange idea. "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Darius claims. "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", claims Mister Kazemi. "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", claims finnish programmer hugovk. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from this month in The Verge says.

Kazemi says, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  an article from this year in The Verge.

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Darius Kazemi says. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", claims Computer Scientist Dr. Riedl. As The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".  Claims Darius Kazemi, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text".

Are human writers obsolete? Not yet, but they're working on it.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Computers Create Fiction, And Would You Want To Read It

By Steven Dzieza @StevenDzieza for Fusion

It's November, and aspiring novelists are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which asks them to produce a 50,000 word novella in a single month. But a  hundred or so generative art pioneers are participating in a strange derivative institution in which computers do the writing for them. The entries are a strange, often funny look at what automatic text generation is like.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted out an unusual idea. Darius Kazemi says, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". Says Mister Kazemi, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", says github user Hugo van Kemenade. As A reporter in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", Kazemi claims. "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories.

"But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last year in The Verge writes.  "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words", Mister Kazemi claims.

Claims Kazemi, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". "It's not hard to generate a story", says Georgia Institute of Technology professor Riedl.

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think I'll be changing my before-bed reading in the next few years.
