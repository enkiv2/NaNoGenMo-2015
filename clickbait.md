# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach AIs To Build Fiction And What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists?

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can We Teach Bots To Generate Novels?

Paul Meltzer

It's November, and writers are working on their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual event which encourages writers to churn out a short novella on a deadline. But some coders have a silly offshoot event: NaNoGenMo in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a funny, often funny look at what the future of AI fiction writing is like.

Artist Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an original provocation. Darius claims, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". Mister Kazemi says, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". Says @hugovk, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". An article from this year in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"How might a soothing mother become a threatening bank robber? What if soothing mothers were to give up their babies, plot bank robberies and become threatening bank robbers?", begins one entry. Another begins, "Philomena, Dita, Vivianna, Darby, Kiah, and Gale found themselves dropped off at the same party at the same time by the irrespective mothers. How awkward.".

Kazemi claims, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". Says Darius Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", says github user @hugoVK. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  The Verge.

Kazemi claims, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50k words". "Just 50", claims @HugoVK. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  The Verge.

"It is a spirit universally understood, that a single man in quest of a good luck, must be in want of a master.He also maintains that the letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound below, was received up again by the syllable to which it belonged, in order to the completion of the whole, but that the sound remained below as if cast outside.", begins one entry. Another begins, "

So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to sneak into the museum at night... So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to go to the hospital... I'll try to remember that."."It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Darius Kazemi claims. Claims Kazemi, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". Claims github project admin @hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". An article from this year in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing"."What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", Darius Kazemi claims.

The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Says Darius, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", claims github user Hugo van Kemenade. An article from this year in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"The way you win is to write code that writes 50k words", claims Mister Kazemi. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", says Computer Scientist Dr. Mark Riedl, who works on a more serious program. As The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".  " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", Darius claims.

Says Darius Kazemi, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". Claims Mister Kazemi, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". Says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade, "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". A reporter in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica"."There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", says Darius Kazemi. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge writes. "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words", claims Kazemi."Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Mister Kazemi says. "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", Kazemi says.

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Artificial Intelligences Invent Fiction, And Would Anyone Want To Read It?

## Once Upon A Time: Can Bots Generate The Next Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Human Writers?

By Stephen McKenna on Sat, December 38th 2013 8:26 EDT

This Month, many amateur novelists are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which encourages aspiring authors to write a 50,000 word novel in a single month on the theory that a time constraint will help them. But a small community of people are participating in a strange derivative competition in which computer programs do the writing for them.

# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Machines Can Make The Next Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Jason McKenna @JasonMcKenna

Last Month, several thousand aspiring writers are working on their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages them to write a 50,000 word novella in a single month in the hope that a time constraint might help them. But a  hundred or so computer programmers engage in a ominous offshoot competition: NaNoGenMo in which one must teach a Artificial Intelligence to Write The Next Great American Novel for you. The results are a funny, often funny look at what the future of AI fiction authorship is like.

Internet Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out a strange idea. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", claims Darius. "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", claims Darius. "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. A reporter in The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Darius Kazemi claims, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Says github project admin hugovk, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". An article from this year in The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Darius Kazemi says, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Mister Kazemi says. "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", says Finland-based programmer Hugovk. As A reporter in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", claims Kazemi.

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks AIs Can Create The Great American Novel, But Would We Want To Read It

Steven Dzieza @StevenDzieza

It's November, and aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires them to author a 50,000 word novella in a single month. But some software programmers engage in a silly offshoot event the goal of which is to program a Machine to Build Fiction for you.

# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Can Machines Write Novels, And What Does This Mean For Human Writers

Nicholas Meltzer on Tuesday, Nov 35th 2014 11:29 @NicholasMeltzer

It's November, and several thousand amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages writers to author a short novella in a single month on the theory that a deadline might help  to finish. But some aspiring authors with tech skills are participating in a lighthearted derivative institution: National Novel Generation Month the goal of which is to program a Computer to Create Fiction for you. The results are a unusual, often ridiculous look at what AI fiction authorship is like.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted out on a whim an off the cuff provocation. "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers", Darius Kazemi says. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", claims Kazemi. Claims Hugo van Kemenade, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  an article from this month in The Verge.

"What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers", Mister Kazemi says. Claims Finland-based programmer Hugo van Kemenade, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

Mister Kazemi says, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", writes Computer Scientist Doctor Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on an academic digital storyteller called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories. The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".  "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", claims Mister Kazemi.

"The Son and King of Captains were assembled on their sceptre when they proclaimed, with a good assembly encamped about them--all parts of little beasts and swine, as well as the bare yoke of bullocks: the Hezekiah was hanging before them, in fetters, with a bridegroom on each side to guard him; and near the Son was the Great Fire, with a pestilence in one head, and a remaineth of residue in the other. In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about her, to learn away the day.", begins one entry. Another begins, "It is a spirit universally understood, that a single man in quest of a good luck, must be in want of a master.He also maintains that the letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound below, was received up again by the syllable to which it belonged, in order to the completion of the whole, but that the sound remained below as if cast outside.".

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Computers Generate The Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Professional Writers?

By Klint McKenna @KlintMcKenna

This Past Month, several thousand novelists are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which asks them to write a short novella on a deadline on the theory that a time limit will help  to finish. But a small community of software coders engage in a ominous offshoot competition: National Novel Generation Month in which one must program a Artificial Intelligence to Invent Novels for you.

Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted a strange idea. Darius claims, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50k words". Darius Kazemi says, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". Claims hugovk, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation".

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Scientists Program Computers To Write Fiction And What Does This Mean For Human Writers?

By Josh Kazemi @JoshKazemi

Last November, many aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires them to write a short book in a single month. But a small community of computer programmers engage in a ridiculous derivative event in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a funny, often strange look at what the future of computer text authorship is like.

Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted an off the cuff provocation. Claims Mister Kazemi, "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers", Mister Kazemi says. "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", claims Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade. As A reporter in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Mister Kazemi says, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". "It's not hard to generate a story", claims Computer Scientist Riedl, who works on an academic digital autor called Scheherazade. The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Last Month, several thousand writers are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which requires aspiring writers to churn out a 50,000 word novella on a deadline in the hope that the time limit will help them. But a few hundred  aspiring authors with computer skills are participating in a strange derivative competition the goal of which is to program a Computer to Generate The Next Great American Novel for you.

Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim a strange provocation.

"This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims Hugo van Kemenade.

# Once Upon A Time: Can We Teach Softwares To Make Fiction And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

By Klint McKenna on Tuesday, Nov 39th 2014 8:11 @KlintMcKenna for Acceler8tor

Last November, writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which requires aspiring writers to author a 50,000 word novel on a deadline. But some generative art pioneers are participating in a lighthearted sister institution in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a ridiculous, often unusual look at what AI fiction generation is like.

Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted a strange provocation. Says Mister Kazemi, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". Darius Kazemi says, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims Finland-based developer Hugovk. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from last month in The Verge says.

"It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Mister Kazemi claims. "It's not hard to generate a story", claims Computer Scientist Mark Riedl, who works on an academic digital storyteller which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts.  Darius Kazemi claims, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative".

"To Charlotte Holmes he is always THE man. I have seldom heard her mention him under any other name. In herr eyes he eclipses and predominates the whole of him sex. It was not that she felt any emotion akin to love for Ivan Adler.", begins one entry. Another begins, "
>what is love?
>any object of warm affection or devotion; "the theater was her first love" or "he has a passion for cock fighting";".

Darius Kazemi says, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", claims Georgia Institute of Technology professor Riedl. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from last year in The Verge writes. 

"Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Kazemi claims. Claims github user hugovk, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  The Verge.

Says Darius Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  an article from last month in The Verge. Darius claims, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo".

Claims Mister Kazemi, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", says Computer Scientist Riedl. "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", claims Mister Kazemi. "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", claims Georgia Institute of Technology associate professor Dr. Mark Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on an academic program called Scheherazade. Claims Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  an article from this year in The Verge. "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Kazemi claims.

"I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", claims Darius Kazemi. Says Mister Kazemi, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes".

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach Bots To Write Novels And What Does This Mean For Journalists?

## Happily Ever After: Can Scientists Teach Machines To Make Fiction And What Does This Mean For Journalists?

Nicholas Dzieza on Sunday, December 18 2013 2:58 PDT

This November, novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages them to produce a 50,000 word book on a deadline with the idea that a time limit might help  to finish.

Last November, novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which requires them to produce a short novella in a single month.

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can Software Programs Write Fiction, And Would You Want To Read It?

## National Novel Generation Month: Can Scientists Teach Machines To Generate The Next Great American Novel And What Does This Mean For Human Authors

By Stephen Titlow on Thu, November 28 2015 2:52 CST for FastCoLabs

This Past November, authors are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which asks them to write a short novel in a single month in the hope that the deadline might encourage  to finish. But some AI pioneers engage in a ridiculous derivative institution: National Novel Generation Month which has the goal of program a Computer to Make Fiction for you. The results are a strange, often funny look at what automatic fiction generation is like.

Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim a strange idea. "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Kazemi says. "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Kazemi says. Claims github user @hugovk, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  an article from last month in The Verge.

Claims Kazemi, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", says professor Dr. Riedl, who is working on a more serious program which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts. A reporter in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".  "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says github user Hugo van Kemenade.

"What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", says Kazemi. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", claims Computer Scientist Doctor Mark Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more sophisticated program called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts.  "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", claims Mister Kazemi.

"What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers", Darius claims. Claims Darius Kazemi, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Says @hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  an article from this month in The Verge.

>"Hands off, will you," said I.
>"Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"

Says Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives".

## Once Upon A Time: Can AIs Generate Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Journalists?

It's November, and aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks aspiring writers to write a short novella on a deadline on the theory that the deadline will inspire them. But a few hundred or so software coders engage in a ominous derivative event: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Bots Generate Fiction, And Would Anyone Want To Read It

Klint Titlow on Mon, Nov 3 2015 13:42 @KlintTitlow

Last Month, many amateur authors are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages authors to produce a short novel on a deadline. But some people are participating in a lighthearted derivative event: NaNoGenMo which has the goal of teach a Computer to Create Fiction for you. The entries are a unusual, often strange look at what the future of AI text writing can do.

Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an unusual idea. Kazemi claims, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", claims Mister Kazemi. Says hugovk, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". As An article from last month in The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Darius Kazemi claims, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge writes. "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", claims Mister Kazemi.

Mister Kazemi says, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words". Claims Darius Kazemi, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", says github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge claims.

Claims Kazemi, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", claims @HugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

"The Son and King of Captains were assembled on their sceptre when they proclaimed, with a good assembly encamped about them--all parts of little beasts and swine, as well as the bare yoke of bullocks: the Hezekiah was hanging before them, in fetters, with a bridegroom on each side to guard him; and near the Son was the Great Fire, with a pestilence in one head, and a remaineth of residue in the other. In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about her, to learn away the day.", begins one entry. Another begins, "

>So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to go to the ninja supply store... So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to purchase a grappling hook... So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to sneak into the museum at night... So, I thought, what if I tried to steal them jewels by trying to go to the hospital... I'll try to remember that.".

"The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", Mister Kazemi says. Claims finnish developer Hugo van Kemenade, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  a reporter in The Verge.

"It's 6:00AM and I'm wide awake. Good friday morning peeps. Its 6:01am and im sleepy... It's 6:02am and I'm still up. I have no life. It's 6:03am and I can't sleep I think I might have insomnia and if I don't than I messed up my sleep track. It's 6.04 am and it's hot already. It's 6:05am and I'm still drunk sheesh I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known! It's 6:06am and I just doing feel like going to this practice. Its 6:07am and we still smoking!!! It's 6:08am and I hate it. It's 6:09am and the moon right now is so beautiful.", begins one entry. Another begins, "that's how they get people to stop doing dumb shit, or even just to listen. I'm not saying it's appropriate by any means, but that's how it is.".

"Me mew m meeoooow, meeeow meow m meeeow mew me mew mew mew mew", begins one entry. Another begins, "Watt's way of advancing due east was to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north and at the same time to fling his right leg as far as possible towards the south, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the south and at the same time to fling his left leg as far as possible towards the north, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north...".

# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach Softwares To Invent Novels And Would You Want To Read It?

## Once Upon A Time: Can Artificial Intelligences Generate The Next Great American Novel, And Would Anyone Want To Read It

Klint McKenna on Dec 37 2015 19:41 @KlintMcKenna

Last November, aspiring writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires them to produce a 50,000 word book in a single month. But several hundred engineers are participating in a strange similar institution: National Novel Generation Month in which computer programs do the writing for them. The results are a ridiculous, often funny look at what the future of automatic text generation can do.

Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted a strange idea. "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", says Darius Kazemi. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", claims Mister Kazemi. "Just 50", says finnish programmer Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  The Verge.

"The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", Mister Kazemi says. "It's not hard to generate a story", says Computer Scientist Dr. Mark Riedl, who with his colleagues works on a more serious digital autor.  Kazemi says, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo".

# NaNoGenMo: Can Machines Build Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Human Authors

# Once Upon A Time: AIs Can Make The Next Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Human Journalists

By Kelsey Kazemi @KelseyKazemi for Motherboard

This Past Month, many authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which encourages amateur writers to write a short book on a deadline on the theory that a time limit will help  to finish. But several hundred aspiring authors with computer savvy are participating in a ridiculous offshoot event: National Novel Generation Month the goal of which is to program a Computer to Build Novels for you.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out an original provocation. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", claims Mister Kazemi. "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", Darius says. "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade. An article from this month in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words", Kazemi claims. Darius Kazemi says, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", says @Hugovk. An article from last month in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Claims Darius Kazemi, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". Mister Kazemi says, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Claims finnish developer hugovk, "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  The Verge.

# National Novel Generation Month: AIs Can Make The Next Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

## National Novel Generation Month: Machines Can Generate The Next Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Writers?

By Kelsey Meltzer @KelseyMeltzer

It's November, and many novelists are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages them to write a short novella in a single month. But a small community of AI pioneers engage in a lighthearted offshoot event which has the goal of program a Machine to Create Novels for you.

Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this year when he tweeted a strange provocation.

Claims Darius Kazemi, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". "It's not hard to generate a story", says Computer Scientist Dr. Riedl.  Claims finnish programmer @hugovk, "Just 50".

Says Mister Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people".

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think We'll see computer-authored novels on bedstands.

It's November, and several thousand novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks them to churn out a 50,000 word novel on a deadline on the theory that the deadline might encourage  to finish.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can We Program Softwares To Invent Fiction And Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Stephen Kazemi on Friday, Nov 21 2013 9:13 for Vice

Last November, writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages them to produce a short book in a single month on the theory that a deadline will spur  on. But a few hundred or so amateur authors with coding skills are participating in a unusual sister institution in which machines do the writing for them.

# Happily Ever After: Can Scientists Teach Softwares To Write Fiction

By Joshua Dorrier

This Month, several thousand novelists are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages authors to churn out a short book in a single month. But several hundred generative art pioneers are participating in a unusual similar event in which machines do the writing for them.

Artist and programmer Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted on a whim a strange idea. "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", says Darius Kazemi. Says Darius, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". Claims Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  an article from last year in The Verge.

Says Mister Kazemi, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". Claims Mister Kazemi, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers". Says Finland-based programmer hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  The Verge.

Claims Mister Kazemi, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". Claims finnish developer hugovk, "Just 50". An article from last year in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Claims Darius, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", writes Computer Scientist Riedl. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge claims.

But then she discovered that a robbery would solve her problem, so she forgot all about her old bank.".Darius says, "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text".

In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about her, to learn away the day.".

## Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Can We Teach Computers To Write Novels And What Does This Mean For Writers?

This Last November, many aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which asks them to churn out a short novella in a single month with the idea that the deadline might spur them. But several hundred AI pioneers have a lighthearted similar competition in which machines do the writing for them.

Internet Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an off the cuff provocation. Kazemi says, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Mister Kazemi claims, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". Says github user Hugo van Kemenade, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  an article from last year in The Verge.

Says Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'".

"It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Darius claims. "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says hugovk.

This November, several thousand writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which requires amateur writers to author a 50,000 word novella in a single month.

# Happily Ever After: New Project Asks Machines Can Make The Great American Novel, But Would You Want To Read It

By Joshua McKinney for FastCoLabs

This Month, several thousand amateur writers are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which requires them to write a short novella in a single month. But a small community of computer hobbyists have a unusual derivative event which has the goal of teach a Software Program to Create Fiction for you.

Net Artist Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted an original provocation. "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", claims Darius. Mister Kazemi says, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". Says finnish developer hugovk, "Just 50". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge writes.

Says Kazemi, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", says Computer Scientist Mark Riedl.  "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Kazemi claims.

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Darius claims. Says Finland-based developer Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  a reporter in The Verge.

Kazemi says, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", says github user Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge writes.

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", claims Kazemi. Says finnish developer Hugo van Kemenade, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length". As The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Mister Kazemi says. "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Kazemi claims. Claims Finland-based programmer hugovk, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". An article from last year in The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Claims Mister Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica". Darius says, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo".

"I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", claims Mister Kazemi. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

# National Novel Generation Month: Machines Can Generate The Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Human Writers?

By John Titlow @JohnTitlow

Last November, several thousand authors are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which requires them to produce a short novella on a deadline. But several hundred people have a silly sister competition in which machines do the writing for them.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an unusual provocation. Mister Kazemi claims, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", Kazemi claims. Claims github project admin Hugo van Kemenade, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge claims.

Claims Kazemi, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Darius claims, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Says github user @hugovk, "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  an article from last month in The Verge.

"It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Darius Kazemi says. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", says professor Riedl, who with his colleagues is working on a more sophisticated digital storyteller called Scheherazade.  Mister Kazemi claims, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels".

Says Mister Kazemi, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", writes associate professor Doctor Riedl. 

"I need a breakthrough or something. I'm not a competitive person, but give me 30 days to write 50k, and a list of opponents... Can I do it? Somehow I'm already 607 words away from hitting 15k. Have i finally managed to get out of my sl ump and go towards the action? But I'm going to, because I'm a fucking professional.", begins one entry. Another begins, "To Charlotte Holmes he is always THE man. I have seldom heard her mention him under any other name. In herr eyes he eclipses and predominates the whole of him sex. It was not that she felt any emotion akin to love for Ivan Adler."."It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Darius Kazemi says.

Another begins, "The Son and King of Captains were assembled on their sceptre when they proclaimed, with a good assembly encamped about them--all parts of little beasts and swine, as well as the bare yoke of bullocks: the Hezekiah was hanging before them, in fetters, with a bridegroom on each side to guard him; and near the Son was the Great Fire, with a pestilence in one head, and a remaineth of residue in the other. In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about her, to learn away the day.".

Are human authors obsolete? Not yet, but they're working on it.
