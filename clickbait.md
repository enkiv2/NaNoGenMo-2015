# NaNoGenMo: Can Scientists Program Machines To Make Fiction And What Does This Mean For Human Authors?

## Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can We Program Computers To Generate Novels

By Nicholas Meltzer on Nov 9 2014 15:24 @NicholasMeltzer for SocialHub

Last Month, writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which requires them to churn out a 50,000 word book in a single month on the theory that a time constraint might spur  to finish. But some people are participating in a silly offshoot competition the goal of which is to program a Bot to Invent Fiction for you.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an unusual provocation. Says Mister Kazemi, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". Mister Kazemi says, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". Claims github project admin @hugovk, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". As A reporter in The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", Mister Kazemi claims. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", writes Computer Scientist Mark Riedl, who is working on an academic digital autor called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories about, say, going to the movies or a resturant. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  a reporter in The Verge.  "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Darius says.

"It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Mister Kazemi says. "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", says Computer Scientist Mark Riedl. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from this year in The Verge says.  "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", Kazemi claims.

"It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", claims Mister Kazemi. "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull", says Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  The Verge.

A reporter in The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Another begins, "What if there was a banker who lost her bank and couldn't get money? But then she discovered that a robbery would solve her problem, so she forgot all about her old bank.".

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", claims Darius Kazemi.

The Verge writes, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Computers Create Novels, And Would We Want To Read It

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can We Program Computers To Invent Novels?

By Stephen McKinney @StephenMcKinney for Fusion

It's November, and many authors are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages aspiring authors to produce a short novella on a deadline on the theory that the deadline might encourage  on. But a  hundred  AI pioneers have a strange derivative competition in which one must teach a Artificial Intelligence to Build The Great American Novel for you. The results are a strange, often strange look at what the future of AI fiction generation can do.

Artist and software developer Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo last year when he tweeted on a whim a strange provocation. Darius Kazemi says, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words". Darius says, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", says github project admin @Hugovk. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  The Verge.

"Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", claims Mister Kazemi. " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", says github user Hugo van Kemenade. The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

"It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Darius Kazemi says. "It's not hard to generate a story", writes professor Dr. Mark Riedl, who is working on an academic digital story generator.  "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", says Finland-based programmer hugovk.

"It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", Kazemi says.

# NaNoGenMo: Can We Teach Machines To Build Novels And What Does This Mean For Journalists

Steven Titlow for KurzweilAI

Last Month, several thousand authors are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages authors to author a short book in a single month with the idea that a deadline might help them. But some engineers engage in a ominous offshoot event: National Novel Generation Month the goal of which is to program a AI to Invent Novels for you.

Artist and computer developer Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted a strange idea. Kazemi says, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". Says Kazemi, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers". "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", claims finnish developer HugoVK.

Kazemi claims, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words".

"It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", says Kazemi. "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", claims Darius Kazemi.

An article from this month in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

Darius says, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can We Program Bots To Write Novels?

## Happily Ever After: Can AIs Create The Next Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Human Writers?

By Klint Meltzer

This Last November, amateur novelists are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages writers to write a 50,000 word novella in a single month.

Last Month, writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which asks them to produce a 50,000 word novella in a single month. But some generative art pioneers have a unusual derivative institution: NaNoGenMo which has the goal of teach a Machine to Invent Fiction for you.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted an off the cuff idea. "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words", Mister Kazemi says. Kazemi says, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Claims github user Hugo van Kemenade, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  The Verge.

Says Darius, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers". An article from last month in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica". "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", says Darius.

Darius Kazemi claims, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length", claims github user Hugo van Kemenade. An article from this year in The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

"What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers", says Mister Kazemi. "It's not hard to generate a story", claims Computer Scientist Riedl, who with his colleagues works on an academic program which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts.  "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", claims Hugo van Kemenade.

"Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", Darius Kazemi says.

# National Novel Generation Month: Can Scientists Program AIs To Write Fiction And Would We Want To Read It?

## National Novel Generation Month: Can Machines Build The Next Great American Novel, And Would Anyone Want To Read It

Steven Dorrier @StevenDorrier

Last November, many novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires them to produce a short novella on a deadline. But some amateur authors with programming savvy are participating in a silly similar competition in which one must teach a Machine to Create Fiction for you. The entries are a ridiculous, often strange look at what the future of AI fiction writing is like.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted an off the cuff idea. "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", says Kazemi. Claims Kazemi, "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page". Says github user @hugovk, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  The Verge.

# Once Upon A Time: Software Programs Can Make Novels, But What Does This Mean For Human Writers?

Joshua Kazemi @JoshuaKazemi

Last Month, several thousand amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which asks them to produce a short novel on a deadline with the idea that the deadline might spur them. But some computer hobbyists engage in a silly sister competition: NaNoGenMo in which machines do the writing for them. The entries are a ridiculous, often unusual look at what the future of automatic fiction authorship can do.

Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month this last year when he tweeted out on a whim an off the cuff provocation. Darius Kazemi claims, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", says Kazemi.

"For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", claims Computer Scientist Doctor Riedl, who with his colleagues works on a more sophisticated digital autor called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories.

# National Novel Generation Month: AIs Can Build Fiction, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Nick Dzieza

This Past Month, several thousand authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires writers to produce a short book in a single month.

# National Novel Generation Month: Machines Can Make Novels, But What Does This Mean For Human Journalists

Thomas Dorrier @ThomasDorrier for Vice

This Month, amateur authors are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which asks authors to produce a short novel on a deadline on the theory that a time limit will inspire them. But a small community of generative art pioneers are participating in a ominous sister competition which has the goal of program a Artificial Intelligence to Create The Great American Novel for you. The results are a unusual, often strange look at what automatic fiction authorship is like.

## Once Upon A Time: Can Softwares Invent Novels, And Would We Want To Read It?

It's November, and authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages them to produce a short novel in a single month. But a small community of computer hobbyists engage in a ridiculous offshoot institution: NaNoGenMo in which computers do the writing for them.

Net Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo this last year when he tweeted an original idea.

# NaNoGenMo: Softwares Can Write Novels, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can We Program Artificial Intelligences To Build Fiction

By Nicholas Dorrier on Wednesday, December 36th 2015 3:23 for VERGE

It's November, and several thousand writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which requires authors to churn out a 50,000 word novel on a deadline. But several hundred amateur authors with tech savvy engage in a strange offshoot institution in which machines do the writing for them. The entries are a ridiculous, often ridiculous look at what AI fiction authorship is like.

Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted a strange idea. "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", Kazemi claims.

"I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", Darius says. "It's not hard to generate a story", writes Computer Scientist Doctor Riedl.  Says Mister Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words".

"How might a soothing mother become a threatening bank robber? What if soothing mothers were to give up their babies, plot bank robberies and become threatening bank robbers?", begins one entry. Another begins, "Hail me Ishmael. Some lightyears agonever mind how long preciselyhaving little or no credit in my cred-pod, and nothing particular to interest me on orbit, I thought I would sail about a little and see the empty part of the galaxy.

Whenever I find myself growing lovely about the mouth; whenever it is a low-pressure, drizzly November in my cortical stack; whenever I find myself compulsively pausing before deathpod warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every recycling I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the tube, and methodically knocking peoples hats offthen, I account it high time to get to void as soon as I can.".

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Bots Can Invent Novels, But Would You Want To Read It?

Last November, aspiring writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which asks them to write a 50,000 word book on a deadline in the hope that a deadline might encourage them. But a  hundred or so software programmers engage in a silly similar institution in which machines do the writing for them. The results are a funny, often funny look at what the future of computer text writing is like.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can We Teach AIs To Invent Fiction

## Happily Ever After: New Project Asks AIs Can Build Fiction, But Would You Want To Read It?

Nick Kazemi @NickKazemi for FictionHub

Last Month, many aspiring writers are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages them to write a short book on a deadline. But a few hundred or so software coders engage in a ridiculous offshoot institution: National Novel Generation Month the goal of which is to program a Software to Write The Next Great American Novel for you.

# NaNoGenMo: Can Artificial Intelligences Write Novels, And What Does This Mean For Professional Authors?

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Scientists Program AIs To Make Novels And What Does This Mean For Human Journalists?

Paul Kazemi on Wednesday, Dec 13th 2013 18:41 for FastCoCreate

It's November, and many amateur authors are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual event which requires writers to churn out a 50,000 word novel on a deadline. But some generative art pioneers engage in a silly derivative event: National Novel Generation Month in which one must program a Software Program to Create The Next Great American Novel for you. The entries are a funny, often strange look at what automatic fiction authorship is like.

Darius Kazemi says, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", claims Computer Scientist Doctor Mark Riedl, who works on an academic program called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts.

Kazemi claims, "What I want to see is ... computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Bots Invent The Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Authors?

By Paul McKenna on December 22th 2015 4:47 for Motherboard

This Last November, many novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages them to churn out a 50,000 word novella on a deadline on the theory that the deadline will spur  on. But several hundred software programmers are participating in a silly similar event: NaNoGenMo in which computer programs do the writing for them.

Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted out a strange idea. "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Darius Kazemi says.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can Computers Create Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Human Authors?

Jason McKenna on Nov 5 2014 13:48 EDT @JasonMcKenna

This Last November, novelists are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks amateur writers to produce a 50,000 word novella on a deadline on the theory that the time limit might help them. But a small community of generative art pioneers engage in a lighthearted similar event in which one must program a Computer to Make The Great American Novel for you. The entries are a ridiculous, often strange look at what automatic fiction generation is like.

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Bots Create Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Journalists

It's November, and aspiring novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which asks amateur writers to churn out a 50,000 word book on a deadline with the idea that a time limit will encourage  to finish. But a small community of AI pioneers are participating in a ridiculous sister competition which has the goal of program a Machine to Generate Novels for you.

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", says Kazemi.

"Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Mister Kazemi says. "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", claims Computer Scientist Riedl, who works on a more sophisticated program.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Machines Can Make The Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

Jason McKinney on Wednesday, November 21th 2014 11:23 BDT @JasonMcKinney for FastCoExist

Last Month, many aspiring authors are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages amateur authors to write a short novella in a single month with the idea that the time limit will help them. But some amateur authors with coding savvy engage in a lighthearted offshoot event: NaNoGenMo in which computer software do the writing for them. The entries are a ridiculous, often funny look at what the future of automatic text writing is like.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out an off the cuff idea. Says Darius Kazemi, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won". "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Darius Kazemi says. "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", says finnish developer Hugo van Kemenade.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Machines Can Invent Novels, But What Does This Mean For Professional Journalists

It's November, and writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which asks writers to write a short novel on a deadline.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can Bots Create Novels, And Would You Want To Read It?

This Month, novelists are working on finishing their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which asks writers to author a short novel in a single month with the idea that the deadline will spur them.

Paul Dorrier on Mon, November 34 2015 13:25 for Vice

It's November, and many amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which asks writers to write a short novel in a single month. But several hundred people engage in a strange offshoot competition which has the goal of teach a AI to Make Fiction for you.

Software Artist and software entrepreneur Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo last year when he tweeted out a strange provocation. "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", claims Mister Kazemi. Kazemi says, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense". "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times", says hugovk. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  The Verge.

"Watt's way of advancing due east was to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north and at the same time to fling his right leg as far as possible towards the south, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the south and at the same time to fling his left leg as far as possible towards the north, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north...", begins one entry. Another begins, "What if there was a banker who lost her bank and couldn't get money? But then she discovered that a robbery would solve her problem, so she forgot all about her old bank.".

Says Mister Kazemi, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", a reporter in The Verge writes. Darius says, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives".

"Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", says Darius. As The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing". Kazemi says, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels".

"It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", says Kazemi. Mister Kazemi claims, "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes". Says github project admin hugovk, "Just 50".

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Machines Write Novels, And What Does This Mean For Authors

## NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks AIs Can Write Fiction, But Would You Want To Read It

John McKinney on Weds, November 13th 2013 6:13 @JohnMcKinney for Motherboard

It's November, and amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which asks them to produce a short novel on a deadline. But a  hundred  software engineers engage in a ominous similar competition: NaNoGenMo which has the goal of teach a Machine to Build The Next Great American Novel for you. The entries are a strange, often unusual look at what automatic fiction writing can do.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted out a strange idea. "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", says Darius Kazemi. "The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", says Darius. "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", claims hugoVK.

"The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words", Kazemi claims. Claims Hugo van Kemenade, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge claims.

"It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", Darius claims.

"[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  an article from this month in The Verge.

It's 6:08am and I hate it. It's 6:09am and the moon right now is so beautiful.", begins one entry. Another begins, "Miles from the sparse towering modern malls, several kilometers down a sidewalk, just outside the shining and moldy warehouse. The sound of shattering glass resonates.".

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", says Mister Kazemi.

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think I'll be changing my before-bed reading any time soon.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Bots Can Invent Novels, But Would Anyone Want To Read It

By Josh Meltzer on December 8th 2015 9:55 @JoshMeltzer for Guardian

It's November, and many aspiring novelists are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires them to produce a short book in a single month on the theory that a time limit might inspire  on.

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Bots Can Create Fiction, But Would You Want To Read It

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: AIs Can Invent Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Human Authors?

It's November, and many amateur authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires them to produce a short novel in a single month on the theory that a time limit will inspire them. But some people have a ominous sister competition in which computers do the writing for them. The entries are a unusual, often ridiculous look at what the future of AI text writing is like.

Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an original idea. "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'", says Darius.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Softwares Can Build Novels, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

Nick Meltzer on Wednesday, December 34 2015 8:36 @NickMeltzer

This Past November, several thousand aspiring writers are plugging away at their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual event which requires amateur authors to produce a short book on a deadline on the theory that a deadline will spur  on. But several hundred programmers have a lighthearted sister institution: National Novel Generation Month which has the goal of teach a Artificial Intelligence to Generate The Great American Novel for you. The entries are a funny, often ridiculous look at what the future of AI text writing is like.

Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim a strange idea. Mister Kazemi says, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers". Kazemi claims, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". Says hugovk, "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  an article from last year in The Verge.

Darius says, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". "It's not hard to tell a story. It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?", writes Computer Scientist Dr. Riedl. An article from last month in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".  "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", Darius claims.

"I saw a healthy belly. I was cursing myself. I saw chickens going to roost. I roosted. I sent for a clergyman to preach a funeral sermon. I preached a funeral sermon. I saw them out of season. I was having trouble in dressing. I thought I was having trouble in dressing. I saw ears. I tried to enchant others. I enchanted others. I saw a jailer. I saw serpents crawling in the grass before me. I was in a life-boat.", begins one entry. Another begins, "I saw a healthy belly. I was cursing myself. I saw chickens going to roost. I roosted.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Can AIs Build Novels, And Would You Want To Read It?

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Softwares Can Invent The Next Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Human Authors?

Last November, several thousand aspiring novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages authors to churn out a short novella on a deadline. But some aspiring authors with coding savvy engage in a strange offshoot event: National Novel Generation Month the goal of which is to program a AI to Write Fiction for you. The results are a strange, often funny look at what the future of automatic text authorship is like.

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can Scientists Program Machines To Create The Great American Novel

## National Novel Generation Month: Machines Can Make Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Professional Writers

Joshua McKinney

It's November, and several thousand amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires aspiring authors to author a short novel on a deadline in the hope that the deadline might inspire them. But some computer hobbyists are participating in a ridiculous derivative event: NaNoGenMo in which one must teach a AI to Write Novels for you.

Artist Darius Kazemi began NaNoGenMo this last year when he tweeted a strange idea. Claims Darius, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". Says Darius, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". Claims github project admin hugovk, "Just 50". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  a reporter in The Verge.

"To Charlotte Holmes he is always THE man. I have seldom heard her mention him under any other name. In herr eyes he eclipses and predominates the whole of him sex. It was not that she felt any emotion akin to love for Ivan Adler.", begins one entry. Another begins, "

>Once upon a time, the Foxes were angry with Sun...

>So Baldur was prevented from coming back to Asgard.
So I went forth before them crying out, 'Slack, my master!'

>So he chose to feign dullness, and pretend and utter lack of wits.

>So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house fell together.
".

"The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", says Darius Kazemi. Claims Hugo van Kemenade, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from this year in The Verge says.
