# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Bots Can Build Novels, But What Does This Mean For Professional Authors

By John Kazemi on November 11 2013 4:55 @JohnKazemi for Vice

It's November, and aspiring authors are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which requires authors to write a 50,000 word book in a single month on the theory that a time limit might encourage them. But several hundred computer hobbyists are participating in a unusual offshoot competition: National Novel Generation Month in which one must teach a Artificial Intelligence to Generate Fiction for you.

Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an off the cuff idea. "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Kazemi says. Says Darius Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", says github user @hugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", says  an article from this month in The Verge.

Darius Kazemi says, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". Says Hugo van Kemenade, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from this year in The Verge claims.

"The way you win is to write code that writes 50k words", Kazemi claims. An article from this year in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica". Claims Darius, "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won".

"I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", says Darius Kazemi. Darius claims, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words". Claims github project admin @hugovk, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". As The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Says Mister Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", says HugoVK. The Verge says, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing"."It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Kazemi claims. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", says Darius Kazemi. Says @hugovk, "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix". As The Verge writes, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".Claims Kazemi, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative".

"[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", claims  a reporter in The Verge.

"There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", says Mister Kazemi. Says Hugo van Kemenade, "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  The Verge."Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", claims Mister Kazemi.

"[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", says  a reporter in The Verge.

Says Mister Kazemi, "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people". "It's not hard to generate a story", writes Georgia Institute of Technology professor Dr. Riedl, who works on an academic program called Scheherazade which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories. An article from last year in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".  "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Darius Kazemi claims."How might a soothing mother become a threatening bank robber? What if soothing mothers were to give up their babies, plot bank robberies and become threatening bank robbers?", begins one entry. Another begins, "The Son and King of Captains were assembled on their sceptre when they proclaimed, with a good assembly encamped about them--all parts of little beasts and swine, as well as the bare yoke of bullocks: the Hezekiah was hanging before them, in fetters, with a bridegroom on each side to guard him; and near the Son was the Great Fire, with a pestilence in one head, and a remaineth of residue in the other. In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about her, to learn away the day.".Mister Kazemi says, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  a reporter in The Verge. Mister Kazemi says, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives".

Are human writers a thing of the past? Not yet.

# Happily Ever After: AIs Can Build Novels, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

## Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Computers Can Create The Next Great American Novel, But Would Anyone Want To Read It?

By Thom McKenna on Nov 16 2015 5:36 @ThomMcKenna

It's November, and amateur novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which requires aspiring authors to author a 50,000 word novel in a single month on the theory that a time constraint might inspire them. But a small community of computer hobbyists have a silly sister institution: National Novel Generation Month which has the goal of teach a Artificial Intelligence to Build Novels for you.

Darius Kazemi kicked off NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim a strange idea. "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers", says Kazemi. Mister Kazemi claims, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives". Says finnish developer Hugo van Kemenade, "Just 50". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last month in The Verge claims.

Says Darius, "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head". "I needed a big corpus of text to work with", claims finnish programmer @hugoVK. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from this month in The Verge says.

"Hail me Ishmael. Some lightyears agonever mind how long preciselyhaving little or no credit in my cred-pod, and nothing particular to interest me on orbit, I thought I would sail about a little and see the empty part of the galaxy. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing lovely about the mouth; whenever it is a low-pressure, drizzly November in my cortical stack; whenever I find myself compulsively pausing before deathpod warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every recycling I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the tube, and methodically knocking peoples hats offthen, I account it high time to get to void as soon as I can.", begins one entry. Another begins, "Me mew m meeoooow, meeeow meow m meeeow mew me mew mew mew mew".

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think We'll see computer-authored books on nightstands.

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach Softwares To Invent The Next Great American Novel And Would Anyone Want To Read It?

## NaNoGenMo: Can Scientists Teach AIs To Generate Fiction?

By Nicholas McKenna @NicholasMcKenna

Last Month, many amateur authors are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which asks them to churn out a short novel on a deadline. But a few hundred  amateur authors with computer savvy engage in a ominous similar competition the goal of which is to teach a Machine to Generate Novels for you. The results are a ridiculous, often unusual look at what the future of automatic text authorship is like.

# NaNoGenMo: Artificial Intelligences Can Write Novels, But Would We Want To Read It?

## NaNoGenMo: Can Computers Create The Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Human Journalists?

By Thomas Dorrier on November 8th 2013 4:52 @ThomasDorrier for Vice

This November, several thousand aspiring writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages authors to produce a short book in a single month. But several hundred AI pioneers engage in a ridiculous similar event: NaNoGenMo in which computer programs do the writing for them.

Software Artist Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted a strange provocation. Darius claims, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". Says Darius, "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", says finnish programmer Hugo van Kemenade.

# Once Upon A Time: Can Machines Invent The Next Great American Novel, And Would You Want To Read It

By Thomas McKinney

This November, several thousand writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which requires writers to produce a 50,000 word novel on a deadline with the idea that a deadline will inspire  on. But some software coders have a ridiculous derivative event: National Novel Generation Month in which computers do the writing for them. The results are a strange, often strange look at what the future of automatic fiction generation can do.

Artist Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim an original provocation. "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", claims Darius. Says Kazemi, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo".

"[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge claims.

# Once Upon A Time: Can AIs Write Novels, And Would We Want To Read It?

Jason McKinney @JasonMcKinney for KurzweilAI

It's November, and many aspiring writers are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which asks them to write a short novella in a single month in the hope that a time constraint might inspire them.

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Artificial Intelligences Invent Novels, And What Does This Mean For Human Writers?

## Happily Ever After: Can Scientists Program Bots To Write The Next Great American Novel And Would We Want To Read It

Nicholas McKenna

It's November, and aspiring novelists are working on their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual competition which encourages them to churn out a short novel in a single month on the theory that a time limit will encourage them. But a  hundred  generative art pioneers engage in a ridiculous offshoot institution: National Novel Generation Month the goal of which is to program a Software Program to Write Novels for you.

Software Artist and developer Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an off the cuff provocation. Says Kazemi, "It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text". Mister Kazemi claims, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels".

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Machines Build Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Human Journalists?

By Kelsey Kazemi @KelseyKazemi for Guardian

Last Month, many amateur writers are trying to finish their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which asks them to author a short novella on a deadline. But several hundred AI pioneers engage in a ridiculous derivative institution: National Novel Generation Month in which machines do the writing for them.

Net Artist and developer Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo last year when he tweeted on a whim an unusual idea. "It sort of turned on a lightbulb in my head", claims Darius. "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers", claims Darius. " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", says github user Hugo van Kemenade. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  The Verge.

# NaNoGenMo: New Project Asks Can Scientists Teach Artificial Intelligences To Generate Novels And What Does This Mean For Professional Writers

## NaNoGenMo: Can Scientists Teach Softwares To Invent Novels And What Does This Mean For Authors

By Joshua Dzieza for Vice

It's November, and novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages amateur authors to churn out a 50,000 word novel in a single month with the idea that a time limit might encourage  to finish. But some generative art pioneers engage in a strange derivative event: NaNoGenMo the goal of which is to teach a Software Program to Build Fiction for you.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted a strange idea. Mister Kazemi says, "What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers". "The way you win is to write code that writes 50 thousand words", claims Kazemi. "[The generated novel] is probably popular because it's just such a stupid idea", claims finnish programmer HugoVK. A reporter in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

Claims Darius, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". Says @hugovk, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". An article from this year in The Verge claims, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

"Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", claims Kazemi.

"Watt's way of advancing due east was to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north and at the same time to fling his right leg as far as possible towards the south, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the south and at the same time to fling his left leg as far as possible towards the north, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north...", begins one entry.

It's 6:05am and I'm still drunk sheesh I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known! It's 6:06am and I just doing feel like going to this practice. Its 6:07am and we still smoking!!! It's 6:08am and I hate it. It's 6:09am and the moon right now is so beautiful.".

# NaNoGenMo: Machines Can Invent The Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Human Journalists

This Past Month, amateur authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual event which requires writers to write a short book in a single month.

# National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Computers Can Build The Next Great American Novel, But What Does This Mean For Human Authors?

Joshua Titlow

This November, many aspiring authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages them to write a 50,000 word novella on a deadline on the theory that a time limit will encourage them. But several hundred computer programmers engage in a lighthearted offshoot competition in which machines do the writing for them.

"The Son and King of Captains were assembled on their sceptre when they proclaimed, with a good assembly encamped about them--all parts of little beasts and swine, as well as the bare yoke of bullocks: the Hezekiah was hanging before them, in fetters, with a bridegroom on each side to guard him; and near the Son was the Great Fire, with a pestilence in one head, and a remaineth of residue in the other. In the very east of the court was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy, that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about her, to learn away the day.", begins one entry. Another begins, "The first attempt was titled The Pensive Infrastructure.

# NaNoGenMo: Can Scientists Program Computers To Build Novels

## It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Softwares Can Create Novels, But What Does This Mean For Authors

By Jason Titlow on Saturday, November 2 2014 7:39 for Guardian

This November, writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual event which requires amateur authors to author a 50,000 word novel on a deadline. But a small community of amateur authors with computer savvy have a ridiculous derivative institution in which machines do the writing for them.

Artist and developer Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out an unusual idea. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", Mister Kazemi says. Claims Darius, "I got a ton of people responding saying 'Oh my god, I'd totally do that'". Claims github user @hugovk, "I needed a big corpus of text to work with". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", an article from this year in The Verge writes.

Claims Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50k words". "For Scheherazade, a successful story is one in which people will read the story and recognise the activity and not find too many obvious errors", writes Computer Scientist Doctor Riedl, who works on a more sophisticated program which learns how to describe tasks by analysing crowd-sourced human accounts, and then attempts to produce plausible shor stories about, say, going to the movies. 

Says Darius Kazemi, "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo". "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last month in The Verge says. "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", Darius Kazemi claims.

Says Darius, "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels". " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", says finnish programmer @hugoVK. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", writes  The Verge.

"It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", says Darius Kazemi. Says finnish developer Hugo van Kemenade, "This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times".

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can Bots Create Novels, And Would Anyone Want To Read It?

It's November, and aspiring novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which encourages writers to author a short novel on a deadline.

Darius Kazemi began National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out on a whim an unusual idea. "I love it because It's a very simple task, computationally, but does a wonderful job of generating a surprising and funny novel that reads like a new text", says Darius. Says Darius Kazemi, "The way you win is to write code that writes 50,000 words". Says Finland-based developer @hugovk, "000 plain meows would be too simple and rather dull". An article from last month in The Verge says, "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica".

# Once Upon A Time: New Project Asks Can Software Programs Write The Next Great American Novel, And What Does This Mean For Human Journalists?

By Josh Titlow on Nov 9 2015 4:53 PDT for Vox

This Past Month, many novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which asks writers to produce a short novella on a deadline with the idea that a time constraint will inspire  on. But several hundred aspiring authors with tech skills have a ominous sister institution the goal of which is to program a Artificial Intelligence to Create The Next Great American Novel for you.

Darius Kazemi created National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted on a whim an unusual idea. "It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Darius says. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", Darius Kazemi claims. "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", says github user @Hugovk. A reporter in The Verge claims, "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing".

"It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Darius says. Claims Hugo van Kemenade, "But This isn't just "meow" 50,000 times". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  a reporter in The Verge.

Mister Kazemi claims, "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives".

"The first attempt was titled The Pensive Infrastructure. It was a steampunk novella, written in C++, and using classification algorithms. This attempt generated 1861 words but failed due to vertigo. Upon reflection, the work was destroyed because the output was tagged.", begins one entry. Another begins, "Philomena, Dita, Vivianna, Darby, Kiah, and Gale found themselves dropped off at the same party at the same time by the irrespective mothers. How awkward.".

While there's a lot of activity, I don't think I'll be changing my before-bed reading in the next few years.

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: Can Scientists Program Computers To Invent Fiction And Would You Want To Read It?

# It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: New Project Asks Can We Teach Computers To Generate The Great American Novel And What Does This Mean For Journalists?

Nick Kazemi @NickKazemi for Fusion

It's November, and several thousand novelists are taking part in NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which requires authors to write a 50,000 word novel on a deadline. But some people have a ridiculous sister competition in which computer software do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often strange look at what computer text generation is like.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted an unusual provocation. "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end", Darius says. "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative", Kazemi claims. Says Hugo van Kemenade, " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", a reporter in The Verge writes.

## Once Upon A Time: Can Computers Invent The Next Great American Novel, And Would Anyone Want To Read It

It's November, and authors are plugging away at their novels for NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires authors to produce a short book in a single month in the hope that the time constraint might spur them.

## NaNoGenMo: Can Computers Invent Fiction, And What Does This Mean For Professional Writers

# Once Upon A Time: Can We Program Bots To Write The Great American Novel

By Thom Meltzer for Motherboard

Last November, several thousand novelists are trying to finish their work for NaNoWriMo or National Novel Writing Month, an annual insitution which encourages authors to author a short novella in a single month. But a small community of AI pioneers engage in a silly similar event: National Novel Generation Month in which computer programs do the writing for them.

Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month last year when he tweeted on a whim an off the cuff idea. "It's a very disjointed, dream-like narrative, like most NaNoGenMo narratives", claims Kazemi. Darius says, "It reads like crap but it actually does have a forward sense of narrative". "By pulling out abstracted sentences away from their origins, and linking only by a common phrase, you get this interesting mix", claims Hugo van Kemenade. "But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", claims  The Verge.

"What if there was a banker who lost her bank and couldn't get money? But then she discovered that a robbery would solve her problem, so she forgot all about her old bank.", begins one entry. Another begins, "

>Daintiness voluptuousness of hurling,

>feature of the mirth as it seemed to plead,

>while the smallest atom as the swirling,

>contemplate the species of the quickest speed,

>delineation of the prettiest foot d'or,

>even you must make trial began to mirth,

>i'll blow on the other lair or the war,

>in this effeminacy is out of his berth

".

Darius Kazemi claims, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end". "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", The Verge says. "It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", Darius claims.

"It's up to individual participants to decide whether or not they've won", claims Kazemi.

"It's more about doing something that is entertaining to yourself and possibly to other people", Kazemi says.

"I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", says Darius.

# Happily Ever After: Artificial Intelligences Can Build The Next Great American Novel, But Would We Want To Read It

## National Novel Generation Month: New Project Asks Artificial Intelligences Can Generate The Great American Novel, But Would We Want To Read It?

By John Dzieza on Saturday, November 35 2014 3:56 for VERGE

It's November, and authors are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual competition which requires amateur authors to write a 50,000 word book on a deadline with the idea that a deadline might encourage them. But a few hundred or so coders are participating in a lighthearted derivative event in which computer programs do the writing for them. The entries are a funny, often strange look at what AI text writing is like.

Darius Kazemi started National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted out a strange provocation. "Even Nick expects you to maybe read a chapter of it or flip to a random page", says Darius Kazemi. "I decided on a whim last year that it would be fun to do their event but by writing code that writes novels", Mister Kazemi says. " meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation", says github user @hugovk. "[R]eading an entire generated novel is more a feat of endurance than a testament to the quality of the story, which tends to be choppy, flat, or incoherent by the standards of human writing", writes  an article from this year in The Verge.

"What if there was a banker who lost her bank and couldn't get money? But then she discovered that a robbery would solve her problem, so she forgot all about her old bank.", begins one entry. Another begins, "Watt's way of advancing due east was to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north and at the same time to fling his right leg as far as possible towards the south, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the south and at the same time to fling his left leg as far as possible towards the north, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north...".

"The comics that come out give me chills sometimes", Darius Kazemi claims.

# National Novel Generation Month: Bots Can Create Fiction, But What Does This Mean For Writers?

Stephen Meltzer on Sunday, November 2th 2013 7:35

Last November, several thousand amateur writers are taking part in NaNoWriMo, an annual insitution which encourages them to produce a short novel in a single month with the idea that a time limit might encourage them. But some engineers have a ridiculous derivative event: National Novel Generation Month in which computer programs do the writing for them.

Internet Artist Darius Kazemi kicked off National Novel Generation Month in 2013 when he tweeted a strange provocation. "There are no prizes in NaNoWriMo; similarly there are no prizes in NaNoGenMo", Darius Kazemi says. Claims Darius Kazemi, "Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: Spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end".

"But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica", an article from last month in The Verge claims.

"The first attempt was titled The Pensive Infrastructure. It was a steampunk novella, written in C++, and using classification algorithms. This attempt generated 1861 words but failed due to vertigo. Upon reflection, the work was destroyed because the output was tagged.", begins one entry. Another begins, "

>what is love?

>any object of warm affection or devotion; "the theater was her first love" or "he has a passion for cock fighting";".

"

>"There are some hackers running ahead there, if I see right," said I to Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise, I guess; come on!"

>"Avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.

>"Going online?"

>"Hands off, will you," said I.

>"Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"

>"Ain't going online, then?"

>"Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours? Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?"

>"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.

>"Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific networks, and would prefer not to be detained."", begins one entry. Another begins, "

"What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their alien-ness computers writing novels for computers, in a sense", Darius Kazemi says.
